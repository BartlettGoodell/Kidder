      "text": "Speaking Truth To Power\nLocal Commentaries\nFeb 7, 2026\nRolland Kidder \nThis year, our President, Donald Trump, decided to go to Davos, Switzerland for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.\nWhile there he gave his usual, off-the-cuff grievance speech about how Europe and most of the rest of the world was falling behind, and how, under his leadership, America was the best of all nations and was charging ahead.\nThere were some lines in his speech that people laughed at, but, in general, President Trump gave his usual meandering political stump speech, the kind that he typically performs at the rallies he has for his base in this country.\nDespite his being, as our President, the featured speaker, the speech at Davos that everyone is still talking about was not his but was the one made by Mark Carney, the Prime Minister of Canada. It was a well-crafted, articulate analysis by the Prime Minister as to where the world order was going under Trump’s leadership.\nPerhaps, the nub of that speech came when Carney warned that the United States was now leading the world not into a “transition” to a new international system of governance but to a “rupture” in what we have come to know since World War II as a system defined by the rule of law.\nCarney’s speech was not one of grievance, but one of stating the reality of what has been going on since Trump became President in 2025. The President of the United States has not only thrown Canada “under the bus,” he has openly criticized most of America’s former allies in one way or another.\nNoteworthy in Mr. Carney’s speech was that he didn’t stop at just describing the situation as he sees it, he offered a new approach–that it was time for the “middle powers” in the world, like Canada, to seek new alliances between themselves to insure that democracy and the rule of law continue as the basis for international diplomacy.\nThe existing established order, which came out of World War II and was led by the United States, created international institutions and alliances to keep the peace. That order is now being shredded, and the world can no longer count on the United States as it has in the past. Canada and other democracies are adapting to this new reality.\nAs an American, though I appreciated the brilliance and truthfulness of the Prime Minister’s speech–it was a sad day. The Trump administration’s “go-it-alone” foreign policy now being applied with an arrogance that we have never seen–has marginalized the United States on the world stage.\nThe Prime Minister of Canada spoke truth to power. We are forcing our former allies to find new ways to keep the peace in order to preserve democracy in the world–what could be more tragic? Our “go it alone,” America first (and only, it seems) strategy is destroying the credibility of the United States of America.",

      "text": "A Presidency With No Limits\nLocal Commentaries\nJan 17, 2026\nROLLAND KIDDER\nWhether you like our current President or not, one thing that seems to characterize his actions is that there seems to be no limits in what he can do.\nIn a recent two-hour interview with members of the press, he was asked if there were any limits to his global power. President Trump said: “Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It is the only thing that can stop me.” His answer did not mention any Constitutional limitations to his power.\nThe public now is beginning to understand this as reflected in the recent “No Kings” demonstrations that sprung up around the country a few months ago. Kings can do whatever they want to, “the public be damned.” Americans have generally supported strong Presidents, but they have always believed that there are limits to executive authority.\nWe now seem to be in a time when the President can do whatever he wants to without congressional authority or legal precedent. In a typical move this past week, Mr. Trump initiated a criminal investigation of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, an institution created to be independent from the White House.\nYet, likely the most visible exercise of his power has been the whole idea of imposing tariffs on imported goods. It was introduced with great fanfare without action of any kind from the Congress.\nNow, news releases come from the White House taking credit for reducing some of the various tariffs that were imposed. Recently, we were told that there would no longer be a tariff on coffee, furniture, and beef among other items. People started squawking about inflation, so the White House slashed tariffs on a few products,\nBut, what a way to run a government! Merchants, traders and consumers have no idea what to expect from one day to the next.\nThe deployment of the National Guard seems to be another whimsical application of Presidential power. Now, months later, the Supreme Court, in a rare decision, has declared that the President exceeded his authority in randomly sending troops into American cities. Could the tide be turning?\nThere is a local connection to this whole question, as our own Supreme Court Justice, Robert H. Jackson, wrote the seminal decision in 1952 limiting Presidential power in the government’s seizure of the steel mills during the Korean War. President Truman wasn’t happy. Jackson was a Democrat and a friend. But, the issue went beyond friendship–it dealt with the structure of our democracy and the constitutional limits of Presidential power.\nThere is another matter which is particularly irksome to me. There now seems to be no limit on using the White House as a base for making money or expanding one’s personal or business fortune. We have seen everything from meme coins, to crypto businesses, to accepting the gift of a fancy jumbo jet from a foreign government, to foreign real estate deals–all coming from the Trump White House.\nWhatever happened to the emoluments clause in the U.S. Constitution? Are there no limits to using the Oval Office for personal & business dealings?\nEnough said. I think when the Trump Presidency has passed, the country, after reflection, will move to impose more enforceable limits on the exercise of Presidential power.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "China Has The Edge On Electricity \nJan 10, 2026\n ROLLAND KIDDER\nAs Americans we believe that we are always the leaders when it comes to infrastructure and technology. That is not the case with electricity.\nChina already consumes twice as much electrical energy as the United States and is way ahead of us when it comes to the efficiency and capacity of their electric grid to transport energy, including renewable energy, across their country.\nThe most efficient way of transporting electricity anywhere is with high voltage electric lines. The higher the voltage, the more electricity that can be transported.\nIt is hard to build such lines in the United States. People want electricity as long as they aren’t impacted by high tension electric lines. Whenever such lines are proposed, environmental and various opposition groups unite to try to stop their construction.\nMany years ago (the 1980’s) I served as a Trustee of the New York Power Authority. The Authority, at that time, had constructed a high voltage 765 kilovolt (KV) transmission line from the Canadian border to the Utica, NY area to bring in renewable hydro electricity from Quebec.\nThe only way we were able to continue that line to the New York City area was to agree to reduce the voltage to 345 KV and build two parallel lines of towers and wire from Utica down to Westchester County.\nChina has no such restrictions when it comes to building transmission lines. It is a dictatorship, and the government can do pretty much what it wants to.\nWe now have in the United States a total of about 2,000 miles of high voltage lines. In China, they have a total of 22 ultrahigh voltage lines (1,000 KV,) and one of them, by itself, is 2,000 miles long and runs most of the way across China.\nChina outproduces us with renewable electrical energy, but it also produces immense amounts of electricity with its coal-fired power plants. China uses more coal than the rest of the world combined. Its greenhouse gas emissions are greater than the United States and European Union combined.\nYet, when it comes to electrification itself, the driving energy resource of the future…the Chinese are light years ahead of us.\nThis also means, of course, that they are able to manufacture goods and products for export at costs greatly lower than we can in this country.\nAnd, that brings us to tariffs. We can try to squeeze more from the Chinese by imposing tariffs on them, costs which are ultimately paid by the American consumer. But, that doesn’t address the deficiencies of our own energy system when it comes to manufacturing and the cost of producing goods here.\nOne of our biggest deficiencies is our lack of efficient electrical transmission lines in this country. The electrical system in the United States has been built on a state-by-state, lower voltage model. What we need is a national electrical transmission system–like our Interstate Highway system.\nWill we ever get there? Not, it seems, in the near future. In the meantime, the Chinese will keep “eating our lunch” when it comes to the efficiency of their electrical infrastructure as compared to ours.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "For Old Times’ Sake\nLocal Commentaries\nJan 3, 2026\nRolland Kidder\nAn old friend of mine, pretty much of the same vintage, sent me an email suggesting that the words of Auld Lang Syne (roughly translated as meaning “for old times’ sake”) might be an appropriate topic for a column at New Year’s.\nI will give it a try.\nMost of the research I have done attributes the song to the Scottish poet, Robert Burns in 1788. There were other similar songs written prior to that, but he made it famous.\nThe other person who made it famous was Guy Lombardo and his band, the Royal Canadians, who started playing it on New Year’s Eve in this country in 1929. Now, every New Years Eve, as the ball drops to the bottom in Times Square, we hear it blared across the world.\nThe setting for the song though is not Times Square–it is a pub somewhere in Scotland where two old friends are drinking and talking in Scottish brogue about the past and periodically raising a toast to remember things “for old times’ sake.”\nAnd, truly, when you get to be my age, that is what you do on New Year’s Eve–you remember past friendships, good times and bad, and say a word of gratitude that you have experienced it all.\nWhat will happen in the upcoming New Year is the focus of the new generation. They now have to forge ahead and live their lives as we did. We wish them well, and hope that their lives will be as rewarding and memorable as our own.\nBurns describes those two old Scots sitting in that pub in Scotland as being very “Scottish”–“you’ll buy your cup and I’ll buy mine”–no freebie there. But, it will still be a “cup o’kindness.” No hard feelings, only good memories.\nThey’ve left nothing on the field: “We two have run about the slopes, and picked the daisies fine. But we’ve wandered many a weary foot, since auld lang syne.”\nThey have worked together but are still each his own: “We two have paddled in the stream, from morning sun till dine. But seas between us broad have roared, since auld lang syne.”\nAnd, at the end of the day, they remain good friends: “And there’s a hand my trusty friend! And give me a hand o’thine! And we’ll take a right good-will, for auld lang syne.”\nWhat more can be said? Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote that the “old order changeth, yielding place to new.”\nWhen you are our age, on New Year’s Eve, you don’t think about the new–you remember and celebrate the old. “Should old acquaintance be forgot?” Absolutely not! Remember and celebrate it!\nAnother good friend of mine, now deceased, once summarized things when looking back on life with these words: “Thank the Lord for the ships you got on, not the ones you missed.”\nThat is also good advice, and so for old times’ sake–have a Happy New Year!",

It may have happened once or twice before, but then, I think, it was only partially frozen.\nThe snowfall this year has also been significant, i.e. the kind of snow you usually see in January or February. At last count, the Village of Mayville had recorded 58.9 inches of snow.\nWe have already seen, in December, a few ice fishermen on the lake–a scene that usually takes place in mid to late January. Winter is upon us!\nThe other day an eagle landed out on the ice apparently to pick up some frozen food or fish it had spotted. Our dogs, who came during past Christmastimes and were appropriately named by our grandchildren, were outside to do their business and to stretch their legs, then saw the eagle on the ice and took off.\nMy wife screamed, “Come back home, Blitzen!” “Come home, Dasher!” To no avail. The eagle, of course, cooly ignored the dogs until they got close, and then spread its wings and was gone–the frozen lake displaying the scene in all its glory.\nThe dogs got to the spot, looked up at the departing eagle and looked back dejectedly toward the house. Finally, the words “Come home… treat!” got through to them. They turned, ambled and finally loped back toward the house. Dogs understand the word “treat,” and that day was no exception.\nWhen I see the cold and winter and ice descend so early on the lake, I begin reciting in my brain that old Robert Service poem: “‘Twas Christmas day and we were mushing our way over the Dawson Trail. Talk of your cold, through the parka’s fold, it stabbed like a driven nail….”\nIt has been that kind of winter so far. Robert Service finally takes you to “the marge of Lake LaBarge” where he cremates Sam McGee by building a fire from the remains of an old derelict Yukon steamboat. Instead, for heat, I turn up our natural gas stove to get warm and then gaze out on frozen Lake Chautauqua, grateful that I am inside the house looking out.\nJust before ice covered the lake, the migrating white tundra swans came through. I don’t know how they knew that winter was a month early, but here they were. The ice, as it transitions, builds from the shore toward the middle of the lake, and the swans hung out at the perimeter where the ice and open water met.\nAs we know, Chautauqua Lake is now rimmed with hundreds of homes and cottages. Yet, at this time of year, these human structures seem to fade into the background along with the snow that surrounds them. The ice and snow-covered lake predominate. When the wind whips up and the snow is blowing down the frozen lake, you almost feel like you are out on the tundra along with that poet from the Yukon mushing down the Dawson Trail on that sleigh on Christmas Day.\nChautauqua Lake is quite a place. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the humanoids with their activities dominate the lake. Then fall comes and the lake begins to return again to mother nature.\nThen comes Christmas, and this year with early ice cover, it makes you think that you actually are up in the far north. It is just you, the snow-covered ice and the elements.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

It was taught to me by my parents and reinforced by teachings from the Bible– “By their deeds you shall know them.”\nAs kids we also soon learned that there are usually more “talkers” in the world than there are “doers.” People are to be judged more by what they do than by what they say.\nThis translates, of course, into observing the actions vs. the words being daily issued by our President. He is always tweeting or saying things to get people stirred up, but he is also doing things that we need to observe.\nFor example, in the recent campaign for Mayor of the City of New York, President Trump called Mr. Mamdani a “communist” who would be a threat to civilization if elected. After the election, when Mamdani went to the White House, the President shifted instead toward schmoozing the Mayor-elect.\nThat action said a lot to me. It looks like the Trump administration will try to work with the new Mayor… which is a good thing. It also reminds us, that the President is also a New Yorker, has significant investments in the City and would likely prefer to get along with the Mayor of New York than continually be fighting with him.\nAnother recent action of our President is also of note–his pursuit of our largest trading partner led by the biggest communist leader in the world–President Xi of China. Mr. Trump recently traveled about 7,000 miles to meet Xi in South Korea. (It was a short trip for Mr. Xi, as that country is right next door to China.)\nNow, we are told that President Trump will fly to China in April to meet again with Xi. All of the talk and threats about tariffs have not brought the Chinese leader to the United States. We will first meet with him on his turf. These two actions speak volumes about who is in the driver’s seat when it comes to trade and commerce between our two countries. “Actions speak louder than words.”\nSometimes words align with action. For example, with the War in Ukraine (probably more accurately described as the “War against Ukraine,”) the President has been quite consistent in word and deed in putting more pressure on Zelensky than on Putin to end the war. He has publicly admonished the President of Ukraine yet seems to defer to the Russian leader who wants things all his way.\nIn terms of the federal government in Washington, the President’s words have pretty much been followed by action–Musk’s chainsaw firings, a vaccine denier running the Health Department, a FOX News commentator in charge of the Defense Department… these were things that the President promised and has delivered on.\nThe one Department that hasn’t changed much in the nation’s capital is the Treasury Department. Here he has appointed a seasoned Wall Street banker as Secretary. The President grew up around Wall Street and, to his credit, has not appointed a fringe character to run the nation’s economy.\nThere is so much bluster, talk and media spin that comes from this White House, that it is sometimes better to just step back and observe. Actions have always spoken louder than words, and that is still the case.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

I didn’t think much about it when I began to ask “Siri” to dial a phone number or asked “Alexa” to play Johnny Cash on the radio. But, the development of voice recognition technology should have alerted me to the fact that AI was coming.\nNow, you can ask your computer or smart phone almost anything and it will get back to you in a matter of seconds. “I found this on the internet etc.,” giving you at least a preliminary answer to your question.\nIf you want to get into real detail, you can get into a “chat box” which will do in seconds what days and weeks of library research used to do.\nThis can be good…for example, in helping a physician diagnose a particularly rare form of disease or for an engineer looking to resolve a faulty design issue.\nBut, we must also remember that AI, like all technologies, has no moral compass. It can be a force for good, or it can be used to enable criminal activity, promote pornography, or advance any manner of venalities that we as humans are known to pursue. It will likely be these misuses and abuses which will eventually lead to AI’s regulation in one form or another.\nThere is another aspect to AI which human society must also confront, and that is its demand for huge amounts of electricity. AI requires that large computer farms or warehouses be constructed stacked full of interconnected computers. These data centers are high tech, don’t employ a lot of people, make a lot of noise, require extensive cooling/air conditioning and are energy hogs.\nBig data centers being designed now can consume a gigawatt of energy – that is about the same as the electrical load in the City of Philadelphia. The CEO of Google has said that the United States will need about 92 of these to meet expected AI demand. That means 92 new “Philadelphia’s” will be tapping into the grid.\nThe electric grid that we now have is already way behind China, and electricity consumers are gagging on their large electric bills as electric utility companies spend money to try to expand the grid.\nHow all of this will pan out, we don’t know. What we do know is that big money is now chasing AI. What we are now seeing reminds me a bit off the old “dot-com” boom of a couple of decades ago when money was chasing that particular new-tech innovation – and a lot of it finally went bust.\nI am probably getting out-of-my-league in trying to explain the technicalities of AI This is something that my kids understand much better than I do… but, my “ear is to the rails,” and I can hear a big train coming down the tracks – a new monstrous, expensive reality called Artificial Intelligence!",

      "text": "Thanksgiving, Deer Season Go Hand In Hand\nLocal Commentaries\nNov 29, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nIt is Thanksgiving and another deer season is upon us. Many around here will likely spend some time at deer camp that day. In reflecting back, though I have no historical proof of it, I have always thought that the pilgrims likely ate venison along with turkey on that first Thanksgiving Day.\nLooking forward to deer season, I guess, is part of my DNA. I was once Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and Wildlife in the State Assembly. Every year we would have discussions with the DEC Division of Fish and Wildlife about setting the fish and wildlife seasons in New York, including the big game season.\nIn full disclosure, you should also know that I have a Lifetime Sportsman License (which I purchased some years ago) to hunt and fish in the State of New York. I used to be at deer camp every year on opening day. Mobility issues and age have changed that, but I still have great memories of those days.\nThough many may not realize it, we need a deer season. The size of the deer herd needs to be balanced with the resources available to support its population. This is why there are various deer management units around the state. The New York State DEC issues additional permits to take antlerless deer (also called doe permits) depending on the size of the deer herd in those areas.\nUrban dwellers are now feeling the effects of what happens when there are too many deer. Just ask residents of Jamestown or Lakewood. Deer are not dumb. They go where the eating is good and where they will not be bothered by hunters.\nIf we lived in a nonhuman environment, mother nature would maintain a balance in the deer population–predators like wolves and coyotes combined with disease and the weather would naturally contain and limit the size of the deer herd.`\nSince we don’t live in such a pristine environment anymore, it is up to we humans to help balance the deer population–that is why we have a deer season and regulations governing the harvesting of deer.\nEven if you don’t like guns, you will have to admit that it better that deer be taken and used for food rather than seeing them hit by a car and laying alongside the road.\nDeer hunters are a special breed. They understand all of this and are some of the most protective conservationists I have ever met. To them, the woods and the deer are sacrosanct.\nOften, I will ask them: “Did you get a deer yet?” And, the answer will be: “Well, I saw a couple, but I am waiting for the big one.” What they are really saying is that they love being in the woods and are taking their time because they want to stay there as long as they can.\nI can remember the days when the deer population around here was very low. I also remember when there were no turkey to be found, but the pheasant hunting was good. Times and the wildlife environment have changed. Now, there too many deer, and turkey, not pheasants, abound.\nIt is our common obligation to keep the wildlife populations in balance. To my ears, gunshots in the woods this time of year mean not only that Thanksgiving is here and deer season has started, but, also, that winter is right around the corner.\nHaving a hunting season for deer is a good thing. Happy Thanksgiving to all!Top of Form",

      "text": "The Changing Face Of Warfare\nLocal Commentaries\nNov 22, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nSadly, new technologies are often tested first in warfare, on the battlefield–not in commerce or for civilian use.\nFor example, a new technology made its debut in World War I–the airplane. Initially thought of as a remarkable new invention to transport people and goods at speeds and distances never imagined–it became an effective intelligence gathering and killing tool over the trenches and battlefields of France.\nI suppose that if you go way back, to prehistoric times, the same kind of thing happened. The spear was probably invented to protect settlements from predators and to kill animals for food. Of course, it also became a preferred instrument in warfare–in the killing of fellow human beings.\nNow, in the War in Ukraine, and in other places, we see the development of the drone in warfare. When we first heard about drones, they were going to be the new answer to faster delivery of packages. Drones, instead of deliverymen, would come swooping down your driveway and provide next-day service when you ordered a product online.\nInstead, their most effective use to date has been the very efficient way in which they can carry on warfare without subjecting a pilot in a cockpit to being shot down. The Ukrainians and Russians have been the laboratory in developing these new instruments of war. On one daring raid, drones from Ukraine were carried by a truck which had been secretly driven deep into Russia. The drones were released and were able to destroy Russian planes on the ground some 800 miles from the battlefield itself.\nI look upon all of this through two different lenses–one, as a citizen of earth opposed in principle to the idea of war. The second, as a veteran of the Vietnam War and former Naval Officer– knowing that we must be prepared for war and for what it brings.\nAs to the first, it is sad that new technology always has a war-making component. Yet, history seems to prove that to be true.\nAs to being a veteran and former member of the U.S. military–one has to realize that the drone has likely changed the way we will conduct military operations in the future. I would think, for example, that perhaps aircraft carriers may now become drone carriers. Why expose pilots when a drone can do the work?\nDrones may even change the mission of submarines. Perhaps, instead of carrying missiles or torpedoes, submarines will now be built to unleash drones on enemy targets. Because of their stealth, submarines are a potent weapon. Now, they will have one more weapon in their arsenal.\nThis whole discussion is probably a “downer” and something that people don’t want to think about. Yet, we also can’t hide our heads in the sand.\nDrones are here to stay and, unfortunately, as long as humans go to war against each other, they will be an instrument of war.\nRolland Kidder is Stow resident",

The Mayor of the City of New York receives an annual salary of $258,000, with an option of living in a government-owned house at Gracie Mansion. The CEO of Tesla lives in a personally owned, gated compound in Austin, Texas, receives millions in compensation and will be compensated with an additional $1 Trillion Dollar bonus if he can meet some aggressive growth targets for his company.\nOn the basis of raw experience, I think you have to give Elon Musk the edge. He has proven himself to be an effective CEO in Corporate America. He runs multiple companies and Tesla Corporation is now valued at more than Ford, GM and Chrysler combined.\nThe most telling criticism of Mamdani has been about his youth and lack of experience. As he, I was a member of the New York State Assembly and can attest that it is not typically a proven training ground for corporate executives or, for that matter, in leading a city of 8 million people.\nBut, on the matter of understanding people and politics, despite being young, you have to give the edge to Mamdani. He understood the electorate’s desire for affordable living, whereas Musk failed to realize that for many Americans, the institutions that he was destroying in Washington were important to them.\nIt was obvious that the citizens of New York did not buy the argument of President Trump that Mamdani was a “communist.” Most New Yorkers who have been around as long as Trump has, know that Democrats in the City of New York have always been at odds: reformers vs. regulars, liberals vs. moderates. The so-called Democratic Socialists are the new reform/liberal wing of the Democratic Party.\nAs to who will succeed more–Mamdani or Musk–only time will tell. But, I think the challenge will be greatest for Mamdani. Many of his promises as to free busing or lower rents…are issues that will require the acquiescence of others, either in Albany or perhaps even from Washington.\nYet, it is clear that Mamdani has won the political contest with Musk. He got 2 million people to vote for him. Though spending millions, Musk could not muster enough support to beat a Democratic state judge in Wisconsin, and he eventually became so politically toxic for the Republicans that he was quietly eased out of Washington.\nI would think that, going forward, the odds makers in Las Vegas will give the political/governmental edge to Mamdani. The capitalist/business edge will stay with Musk. Diversity in America is alive and well !\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

This morning one of the weather prediction sites said that we could have “intermittent snow” next week.\nI have never been a big winter guy. I think I would be happiest if we had continual rotations of spring and fall – but such is not the case. Winter is a reality, especially around here.\nA good friend calls me about this time every year to discuss the shortness of days. We both get a little down as the daylight hours get shorter and the nights become longer. But, she is an optimist, and I am more of a pessimist.\n“Just think,” she says, “next month we will have the shortest day of the year, and then the days will start getting longer!”\nTo which I retort: “Don’t forget, that day is also the beginning of winter, and then we have the cold of January and February after that!”\nOf course, we are both right – but she sees the upside more than I do.\nAnother harbinger of the coming winter is the insufferable change from daylight savings time to standard time. I like the fact that the sky is lighter in the morning now but then I have to remind myself that the sun is setting earlier in the afternoon – a bummer!\nInterestingly, our dogs have a hard time when the time change comes. They are used to having their evening meal at about 5:30 p.m. After the change to standard time, they started whining for food at about 4:30 p.m. Where is it? Did you forget to feed us?\nWe have tried to explain it to them…but to no avail. We finally cave in and split the difference. They will now be fed at 5 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.\nBut, again, the time change means that winter is coming, even for the dogs. They will, of course, love it. There is nothing like a couple of dogs playing in the snow.\nAnd, the snow, the beloved snow. It will soon be here. Lake Erie is still warm and that means that the first cold air coming over it will pick up a lot of moisture which will miraculously turn to snow when it sweeps over the cold ground.\nUsually, this means that the north-county, along the lake, will get hammered by the first snow falls…so standby Dunkirk, Fredonia, and Westfield – it is coming!\nThen, slowly, the big snow falls will move into the hills where we live. The rising winds will wait to release their snow on the rest of us.\nSo, get your galoshes out, your hats and mittens ready. This is Chautauqua County. If you think you can avoid winter around here, you have another thing coming. Winter around here really means “winter.”\nSince we can’t avoid it, we might as well enjoy it!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

And, so it appeared in the early days of the Trump administration.\nThere was Elon Musk jumping around onstage with his chainsaw empowered with the ability to cut and slash government spending through a new mechanism called DOGE–Department of Government Efficiency.\nThe first agency to go was the United States Agency for International Development (USAID.) Supported in the past by both Republican and Democratic administrations, it was deemed to be unworthy of any more government spending, though no replacement was announced to address famine, pandemics or natural disasters when they occur around the world.\n“Good riddance…USAID is gone!” Its signs were removed from federal buildings. The new administration believed in less government.\nThen came the emails to federal employees, requiring them to justify their jobs or be fired. If you worked for the federal government, you were deemed to be expendable.\n“Finally,” the true believers thought, “we have an administration that is really going to cut (and gut) the federal government!”\nYet, at the same time, moves were being made to increase the power and reach of that same government. In a time of high employment, a Presidential decree came out that said we must protect American jobs with tariffs. An “emergency” was declared, though it is not clear what it was.\nWithout Congressional authorization, tariffs were imposed ranging from 10% to 80% depending on the acquiescence and submissiveness of the foreign government involved. Our friend, Canada, was whacked with up to 50% tariffs, and now another 10% has been added because Ontario ran a pro-Canadian TV ad quoting former President Reagan’s opposition to tariffs.\nThen came a $9 billion dollar federal investment in a private corporation–Intel. The last big bailout of the auto companies took Congressional action, but there was no talk this time about needing to have Congress involved.\nThen there was the $20 billion purchase of Argentine pesos to help bailout Buenos Aires. Who authorized that?\nOr what about the tearing down of the East Wing of the White House to build a new ballroom? Where was Congress on that one?…they were out of town, essentially on vacation, waiting for Speaker Johnson to call them back. At last count though, they were still receiving their paychecks.\nWe are told not to worry about paying our troops during the budget shutdown because an Andrew Mellon heir will purportedly take care of that, and Qatar gifted a fancy new airplane for the White House…no problem there. Even the new White House Ballroom, it is said, will be financed by some, as yet, unannounced, wealthy billionaire.\nAnd, just think of the poor National Guardsmen who thought they had signed up as “weekend warriors.” Now, they may be coming for an indefinite period to police a city near you… as of now, taxpayers are on the hook for that.\nAh, and to think we were about to enter an era of smaller government.\nSit back and relax. In this administration, “best” means “biggest.” Everything is now the biggest it has ever been (including the deficit,) and the long arm of the federal government is bigger than ever.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

If I were in his inner circle, I would advise him that this is an honor for which you are chosen–not one you lobby or campaign for.\nBut, that aside, if he can pull off a solution to the current Israeli/Gazan War, perhaps he should be so honored.\nAs the columnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote: “If Donald Trump is able to secure a cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, return of Israeli hostages, and it holds and paves the way for negotiations on the only solution of two states for two people…Trump will not only deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, he’ll deserve the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry as well. Because that would be quite an achievement.”\nI have not been a fan of Donald Trump’s top-down approach to governing nor of many of his policies — but, I too am hoping that he can find a way out of this terrible war in which Hamas killed some 2,000 Israelis, and where Israel has killed some 60,000 Palestinians in response.\nPresident Trump is in a unique position to end this conflict. First, and foremost, in being as close as he is to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s leader, Trump essentially coopted him, pushing Netanyahu into accepting a ceasefire and bringing the war to an end.\nTrump also has deep roots and connections to the Arab countries of the Middle East, not just as President but through his family and business connections with countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These nations met in Egypt with the United States and hammered out a deal to end the Israeli-Gazan War. Great Britain and France were also supporting the effort. It was not just the United States that was involved.\nAny resolution from the carnage of Gaza to Israel’s exhaustion and diminishment resulting from this war, will require support from Arab nations in the region. Meetings are continuing in Egypt with several countries now involved including representatives from the United Nations.\nSo, Mr. President, I give you credit for getting the parties to the table, and, as an American, I am hoping that your efforts can lead to a permanent peace in the area.\nMy only advice would be that you keep after the effort. It will take time. This is no “slam-dunk,” quick-and-its-over situation. The divisions and hatreds in this part of the world run deep, so whatever solution is arrived at must have staying power and will require a long-term commitment. Wars are easy to start, but difficult to end.\nFriedman addressed this same issue with a question: “Will the Trump administration have the attention, the energy and the focus that’ll be required every day to keep such a complicated solution on track?” “I hope so,” he concludes.\nI hope so too. If President Trump can stop this war, keep it stopped, start a new and responsible governance for Palestine, and keep Israel within its borders…maybe he will be recognized for his work by the Nobel Committees in Norway and Sweden.\nIt may seem unlikely that a President who has created a Department of War instead of Defense would receive a Peace Prize, but stranger things have been known to have happened down through the course of human history.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

You are also becoming aware that you won’t live forever, and having things more simple in your life is good, not only for you, but for your family, for your friends and for those around you.\nSome of this is also health driven. Your body and back just don’t want to do as much work as they used to. Cleaning the floors, shoveling the walk, moving furniture around–all of the things you never thought once about doing–now become more of a hassle. It is time to think about downsizing.\nFriends of ours recently sold their house and moved into an apartment. Other friends sold a home that they had loved and had hosted innumerable parties and get-togethers in…and bought a smaller house, all on one floor with a drive-in garage. In addition, they share the cost of mutual tasks like snow removal, lawn mowing and driveway maintenance with others in the same development. It simplifies things.\nYet, it isn’t easy to move. There are a lot of memories tied up after you spend many years in the same house.\nThere are many other reasons why downsizing is difficult. It is an admission of the fact that you are getting older, it usually requires a change in residence which is difficult under any circumstance, and if often means that you are not going to be as much in the center of the “social swirl” in your life…that is being passed down to the younger generation.\nYet, an upside to downsizing, in my view, is that it reminds you of the importance of family and friends. Often, folks of my age will move to be closer to friends and family–and that is a good thing.\nIt is also important to remember that downsizing is not bad or some kind of anomaly in life. It is a part of the normal thought and decision-making process that comes with aging. It is better to embrace it than to fight it.\nOne final thought about the subject. Timing can be important. It is better to deal with downsizing while you still have the capability of doing so. If you wait too long, others may be “saddled” with having to make that decision for you. Making and implementing decisions while you can is a good thing.\nWhat Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote is true: “The old order changeth, yielding place to new….”\nWelcome to the world of downsizing!",

Yet, somehow, we lost our “mojo.” Along came the fall of China to the communists and then the war in Korea.\nSuddenly, in the 1950’s, we were in a mood of fear and apprehension. Along came Senator Joe McCarthy, “pouring kerosene on the fire,” blaming it all on purported communists in the government and conducting a campaign of fear, falsehoods and blame. The country went into a kind of funk. It took President Eisenhower to steady the ship and then for President John Kennedy to bring us new hope and new direction in 1960.\nA similar pattern developed in the late 1960’s and early ’70’s. The heady years of confronting segregation and passing a Civil Rights Act descended into acrimony and blame during the Vietnam War and these feelings were exacerbated by riots which were erupting in the cities. This negative mood followed Richard Nixon into office. It took President Carter to “steady the ship,” and then President Reagan to instill a renewed sense of confidence and pride again in our national politics.\nNow, again, we are in national funk which seems at least partly related to our misguided wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fear and blame are rampant. It is the “radical” right against the “lunatic” left. There seems to be no middle ground which is where Americans like to be. Seemingly, someone has to always be blamed when things go wrong.\nSadly, I don’t see things much changing with the current administration. We have a President who, right off the bat, blamed the “lunatic left” for the Charlie Kirk assassination. Someone, apparently, had to be blamed, though, at the time, little was known about the assassin.\nNow that Kirk’s assassin has been apprehended, early reports indicate that he was not affiliated with any political party, may have been radicalized by the violence promoted through the internet and video games, was a loner and–like most assassins–he may have mental or emotional issues influencing his behavior. Whatever his motivations, it was a terrible crime.\nYet, it was not a time to fan the flames of hatred through finger-pointing and blame. Sometimes our Commander-in-Chief needs to be our “Healer-in-Chief.” I thought that the Governor of Utah provided better leadership by calling for national mourning and an end to partisan blame-calling. The country needs voices of unity and healing after such horrific incidents.\nSo, what is next?\nIf the cycles of our political life are any indication, a leader will become President who will help stabilize and reunify the country. Then that person, or another, will bring us again to remembering the American spirit and how we have jointly and positively addressed the issues that we have faced in past years.\nIn the end, our national motto “E Pluribus Unum” (out of many one,) will work once more and Americans will come together in unity to tackle the next big problem (or problems) that will inevitably come along.\nThis is our common hope and is what keeps us going as a country.\nTop of Form\nBottom of Form",

But, perhaps, the best headline of the whole year in competitive, professional golf came out of that final match.\nA journey-man golfer, a guy who had tried 163 times to win a golf tournament but without success…would finally win one, and it would be for the whole “shebang,”\nTommy Fleetwood, who had probably come in second on more golf tournaments than any other player currently playing, would win the big one–the one with the most money and a lot of prestige, the FEDEX Cup.\nWhen you watch Tommy Fleetwood play, you would say that he is a bit “out of his league.” He is shorter and slighter than most players. He has long hair and looks a bit like one of the old “hippies” from the ’60’s.\nYet, Fleetwood has a quality which is probably more important than any other in the world of sport–he is persistent. He wouldn’t take “No” for an answer. He kept coming back again and again and after 163 starts as a professional golfer–he finally won.\nThere is a big lesson here. Remember the old saying: “If at once you don’t succeed, try, try again!” There is real truth in it.\nMost people who have a skill or a passion are like Tommy Fleetwood. They are good, they love what they do. Yet, life is not a straight line. We can hit roadblocks, have a bad day, or just be out-competed.\nBut, this is where perseverance comes in. Many will give up and say: “Well, I guess it is not meant to be.” And, they will shift their interest to other things.\nThen, there are people like Tommy Fleetwood who say: “I know I can do it. I am going to stay with it until I win!”\nIt reminds me a bit of a children’s book that my mother used to read to us as kids about the “little engine that could.” It was about an engine pulling a train and going up a hill. It kept chugging slowly along saying: “I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.”\nThen it finally got over the top of the hill, and coming down the other side in a faster cadence the chugging changed to: “I know I can, I know I can, I know I can!”\nThere is something to be said for perseverance. Congratulations, Tommy Fleetwood, on winning the FEDEX Cup!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "War Department Not A Good Idea\nLocal Commentaries\nSep 13, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nOur President announced recently that we should rename the Defense Department, the “War \nDepartment” because we have not been winning enough wars. That is a bad idea.\nMaybe it was an idea that came from some of the “issue for the day” people that he has surrounded himself with, i.e. it didn’t originate from him. But, still, war is not something that we should be embracing, promoting or touting in any manner.\nCongress and the courts should just let the Defense Department remain the “Defense” Department. Let the President sign all of the Executive Orders that he wants to…but let’s not go back to the “War” Department.\nI have often thought, though it may be just happenstance, that Robert H. Jackson may have influenced the renaming of the old War Department as the new “Defense Department” back in 1947. Remember, he had just gone through the major trial of Nazi defendants at Nuremberg.\nOne of Jackson’s observations coming out of that experience is engraved on the flagpole base at the Robert Jackson Center here in town. It says: “If we can root out of men’s thinking that all wars are legal… at last we will have mobilized the forces of law on the side of peace.”\nThe last thing we need to do to promote peace in the world is to go back to the idea that war is inevitable and legitimate. Yes, we do have a right to defend ourselves as a nation…but that gives us no right to frame “war” as an objective by giving it the priority of departmental status in our government.\nAdmittedly, the name change to Defense Department came out of a long-needed reorganization of our military services… an evaluation sparked in many ways by our experience in the Second World War. There had been serious divisions during that conflict between the Army and the Navy, and there was also a perceived need to create the Air Force as a separate service. Better coordination was needed. That reorganization also gave impetus to creating a department of “defense” and not “war.”\nIn the United States, a strong defense has always been framed as a way to avoid war, not to promote it.\nI know something about war, having actually been in one and in combat. It is not something anyone should want.\nSo, Mr. President, I am assuming that the idea of creating a War Department was not a serious proposal, but just something to get people like me riled up. I know that you had a falling out with both General “Mad Dog” Mattis and General Kelly in your first administration, both of whom had distinguished careers in the Marine Corps. But on something as consequential as renaming the Pentagon as the home of “war” instead of “defense,”–perhaps you should pull them back into your orbit one more time and ask them what they might think of such an idea.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a Vietnam veteran.\nTop of Form",

Our farm was located on top of a hill, and we could see the weather coming from the west and then view it to the east as it descended upon Frewsburg and then into the hills around Frew Run and Bone Run.\nWeather became even more a part of my life when I started flying. When you first start flying a plane, you can only fly when the weather is good…it takes time to earn an instrument ticket so that you can fly in clouds and in low visibility.\nBack then, we had just the beginnings of weather radar, and so the FAA Flight Service Stations across the country would report their weather by teletype. You had to learn to read the shorthand symbols that were used, but, by so doing, you could find out the weather at your destination and at airports in between. Was it cloudy, windy, what kind of precipitation, was visibility limited, what was the temperature etc.? It could all be deciphered from those teletype messages. You didn’t want to take off and then be unable to land.\nToday, of course, many airplanes and virtually all commercial flights have weather radar right in the cockpit. You can request changes with FAA flight control while enroute to keep away from bad weather.\nTo me it is mesmerizing just to watch the weather radar on my computer. You can dial in your own location or watch what is happening nationally. You can see the storm systems move and get a sense of what the weather is, and what it will be, at least for the next day or two.\nComputers, of course, have made weather prediction better. We now have years and even decades of data showing how weather has acted or developed in the past…and so the weatherman is pretty good at letting you know at least what to expect in the next 24 or 48 hours.\nHowever, the further out you go in time…the less predictable the predictions are. When my wife tells me what her cell phone is predicting for the weather next week or in two weeks, I take it with a grain of salt.\nAnd, sadly, the weather can still change in a moment and do the unexpected…as was apparently the case in the recent flash-flooding in Texas that claimed so many lives.\nWeather has been and still is the giant in the room. During World War II, D-Day was delayed because of strong winds, and typhoons sank ships in the Pacific. Hurricanes today can destroy coastal communities.\nThere are fewer surprises today because of our better understanding of the weather, especially though the use of satellite imagery. But, storms and bad weather can still pop-up unexpectedly.\nThere is one axiom about the weather which has remained constant over time…you have to respect it. Most aircraft accidents associated with the weather are actually accidents caused by pilots who have put their airplane in a place where it should not have been. Car and boat accidents also happen when people don’t pay attention and drive into dangerous conditions.\nEnough said. The next time you are bored and don’t know which TV show you want to watch…just go to Accu Weather or a similar site and watch the weather come and go. Watching the weather is interesting. It can be quite a show and beats most of what Hollywood produces!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

You had only to drive a few hours north of Toronto before you were in the “bush” as we called it.\nThere is the well-known Algonquin Provincial Park in the Huntsville area, but we also paddled rivers north of North Bay…up in the areas where the roads north end, and the only way to go further north is with a canoe and a paddle.\nWe also liked to canoe rivers with rapids, white water and portages. All food had to be carried in and the water for drinking was the same water in which you were paddling. There is nothing like wilderness canoeing to get you “back to nature” in a hurry.\nAbout 90% of Canadians live south of this, within 200 miles of the U.S. border…but the beauty and immensity of their country north of that is an area comparable to that of the American west. It is a wonderful place to be.\nWe were always welcome in those areas of North America though we were from another country. Canadians also have come south, not just to Ellicottville to ski, but to vacation and spend winter months in Florida.\nThe economy of the United States dwarfs that of Canada, but the two countries have always been close, and friendly relations have existed along a 5,000 mile plus border.\nNow, things have temporarily “soured.” The Canadians have been told that they should become the 51st state, and that, in the meantime, they are going to be treated with tariffs and economic pain.\nNeedless to say, Canadians are not happy about this. Visits to the United States from Canada have declined and some have put their properties up for sale in places like Ellicottville and Florida…and I can’t say that I blame them.\nJust put the “shoe on the other foot.” How would we like it if Canada were more powerful, and they were telling us what to do? We would feel the same way.\nSo, for all of these reasons, I decided to buy a Canadian flag and raise it along with the American flag that we fly from our lawn here on the lake. The Red Maple Leaf flag is a bit smaller and flies beneath “Old Glory,” but there it flies. It seemed to me that it was needed here this summer–not just to assuage any Canadians coming by but to remind us of the neighborliness we have had between our two countries over many years.\nAnd, to be honest, I am not really interested in expanding the United States into any other place whether it be Canada, Greenland or the Panama Canal. We have enough of our own problems to deal with, and working with other nations has always been a better idea than trying to take them over.",

He didn’t make a lot of money in dairy farming, but he also never spared spending when it came to keeping the barn painted, maintaining the farm equipment, or mowing the lawn.\nTo him spartan living did not mean slovenly living. It was important to keep things cleaned up, and to do the best with what you had.\nThat has always stuck with me, and I give a “lot of points” to people and organizations who keep things neat and clean.\nIn that vein, for example, I was pleased recently to notice that the water tower at the Jamestown Airport had been painted. I had noted a couple of years ago that it looked faded and rusty. So “kudos” go to the Town of Ellicott for getting it painted!\nIt may sound “nit-picking,” but, in my view, when you are trying to move things ahead at the airport–the visual impact of something as obvious as a water tower can make a difference.\nIn like manner, on the negative side, I always worry when I see an unpainted house or an unmowed lawn. There may be extenuating circumstances, but often it means that a property may be in decline…and that is not good.\nThis is a generalization, but, in my view, based upon traveling a bit overseas–I have found the Germans too be especially tidy in the way that they live. There is no garbage on side of the road, no houses in need of paint, no abandoned refrigerators in the backyard. One reason that German engineering and business have been so successful over the years is that they keep things neat and clean.\nIt doesn’t mean that we can’t do it in the United States. Some recent foreign visitors to New York City have remarked to me on how clean the City now is, and how impressed they were when they visited. They expected, perhaps based upon past reputation, that the opposite would be true.\nI think that this time of year may be the best time to write about such a subject since everything around here is now pretty much hidden by green. A more revealing time is during March and April after the snow is gone and before the trees bloom.\nOn the plus side, it really perks me up when I see that great care and nurturing are visible. For example, on Sixth Street in Jamestown, just before you pass over the Sixth Street bridge heading west, is a two-story, old, well-kept house. But, what makes it spectacular this time of year is that the lawn, porch and virtually whole front yard is covered with planted flowers. You can’t miss it.\nMaybe the owner works in the floral industry. I don’t know. But, the message being given is clear: “I love this house.” “I love flowers,” and–“Please, enjoy the day!”\nKeeping things spruced up is a good thing, and something we should laud and appreciate. Neatness and taking proper care of things matters.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

      "text": "The Downside Uncertainty Of Tariffs\nAug 2, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nThe Trump administration’s levying of tariffs is a form of taxation, essentially a tax hidden from public view. They are imposed before the final sale of a product. In essence, tariffs are a pre-sales tax, levied at a port-of-entry on goods coming into the country. They are included in the price being paid by Americans for whatever the product is.\nSo, for example, let’s say a carpet made in Vietnam comes into the Port of New York for ultimate sale here. The cost of the carpet goes up 20% when the federal government slaps a tariff on it in New York, and then it comes here where an additional 8% sales tax is added.\nWe know that the 8% added here goes to state and local government. What happens to the 20% going to Washington? We don’t know, though some of it is likely going to help pay off our growing national debt.\nYet, more devasting than the cost of tariffs, is their negative impact because of the unpredictability they cause in the market place. The President seems to raise and lower them at a whim. It is hard to operate a company with a sound business plan when you are not sure how the tariffs are going to affect your business.\nThis past week, I drove past the Cummins Engine plant here and saw fewer cars in the parking lot than I usually see there. When inquiring with someone more familiar with their operations, it seems that Cummins engine orders are way down from where they were a year ago…so shortened work weeks, partial voluntary time reductions etc. are now underway at the plant.\nYou wouldn’t think such a slowdown possible as you still see a lot of trucks on the road. What seems to be happening is that instead of replacing engines as they get old…trucking companies are trying to stretch the life of old engines because they are uncertain as to what the economic effects will be of all of the tariffs being imposed.\nSuch uncertainty also directly affects an international company such as Cummins. They sell a lot of engines in Europe and Asia. If we impose tariffs on those countries, those countries will reciprocate by raising tariffs on our products. That means that our truck engines will become more expensive in those markets…thus, reducing sales.\nIn short, the world economy is like a very finely tuned watch–if one part of it changes, then there are rippling effects down the line. Tariffs create uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good for jobs and the economy.\nIt has been interesting to watch the leaders of various countries coming to pay obeisance to President Trump in the White House. They say good things because they don’t want to be crushed by him with U.S. tariffs.\nBut, the country that matters most–China, has not come groveling to the White House. Instead, the Secretary of the Treasury has been going to places like Geneva and Stockholm to meet with his counterparts from China about trying to strike a deal on tariffs. The Chinese have never liked the idea of “kowtowing”–a Chinese word describing bending the knee or bowing the head to a superior power. They are not going to kowtow to Donald Trump.\nMost industries that we have in America today are affected one way or another by international trade. The economic uncertainty being caused by tariffs is having downside, negative effects.",

But, golf is not just an American sport–it is a world sport.\nAnd, guess who was in the final pairing on Sunday? Yes, a player by the name of Haotong Li, from China. The lesson here was obvious: competitors don’t have to be enemies. The world of sport teaches you that.\nIt is true that I don’t like the fact that the Chinese government is run by a dictatorship. Yet, I don’t hold that against the Chinese people. They are people just as we are, and they have good athletes. The world of sport teaches that.\nIn addition, not everything that we have and enjoy was invented in America. Golf was “invented,” so-to-speak, in Scotland. The organization that started it, frames the rules that govern it, and sponsors The Open each year is named “The Royal and Ancient” (R & A)–and it makes its home at the place the sport originated…St. Andrews, Scotland.\nThis all gets personal for me, because I have been privileged in my lifetime to have played the Old Course at St. Andrews. Also, on one terribly rainy and windy day, I tried to play Royal Portrush–where The Open was played this past weekend.\nI say “tried” to play, as the playing conditions got so rough that I couldn’t keep the ball in the fairway. I took out a three wood on a 150-yard par three, hit it as hard as I could into the wind, and put it in a gully short of the green. (You can tell that I am not a great golfer.) After that, I picked up my ball and walked the rest of the course with my friends. I had not played Royal Portrush, it had “played” me.\nThe favorite at this year’s tournament was Rory McIlroy from Northern Ireland. He, obviously, didn’t win, but made some meaningful remarks at the end reminding the world that the playing of The Open at Portrush was again possible because the fighting had finally stopped a few years back between northern and southern Ireland.\nThat is another lesson we can learn from sport…it can be a bridge for “bridging” our differences.\nThen there is the always beautiful ending of The Open, when the President of the R & A presents the Gold Medal and the Claret Jug to the “Golfer of the Year.” The golfer of the year in the U.K. is not the person who won The Masters, the PGA, the US Open or is rated number one in the world–it is he who has survived and prevailed over four tough days in all kinds of weather in the oldest international tournament in golf in the land where it started. To the Brits, that defines who the golfer of the year is.\nFinally, there was the presentation made to Scottie Sheffler, who, standing next to his wife with his year-old son in his arms, graciously accepted the honor. No politics or breast-beating about who was from what country, but a message that the importance of family trumps everything…including nationality and sport itself.\nAnd, the fact that Portrush is a small town of about 6,000, and the golf club is a public course – what a story in itself! Sport can teach us a lot about the good things of life…as it did in Ireland last weekend.",

When she got home that day, she realized that the walker she brought home from Chautauqua was not the one she had taken to the lecture.\nJust think about it. There are a number of people at Chautauqua who use these devices–and, except for differences in color, they all look pretty much the same. Result–you can bring one home that may not be the same as the one you took.\nAnd, when that happens, a whole series of additional events is triggered. The person now missing their walker, realizing probably what had happened, took a similar-looking walker and started home…hoping that somehow the mistake would be realized, and that things could be rectified.\nWhen that bereaved owner, missing her own walker, “borrowed” another to get home, another person came up and said: “I’m sorry, but that is my walker. Here, you can have this one.” That one was my wife’s and that is how it was eventually returned to her.\nHad it made it into the newspaper, the headline would probably have been: “Missing Rollator Mystifies Chautauqua!”\nOf course, the mystery was soon solved. The next day, a posting on social media was made by the person whose rollator/walker had disappeared. When my wife met her to exchange walkers, it was found that the story had been even more intriguing than thought.\nIn short, a three-way exchange was needed in order to finally rectify the mistaken, innocent absconding of similar-looking walkers, all which had been parked near each other behind the amphitheater during the lecture.\nA simple mistake had become complex–a multiple return and exchange was required to finally resolve things. And…so it goes as we relearn one of the lessons of life. When things look the same, complex things can happen.\nThe whole episode reminded me of similar things happening when we were kids in elementary school. Sometimes someone would mistakenly take the wrong bike from the bike-rack after school and then ride it home. At times, the mistaken “exchange” had resulted in a better bike being taken than the one brought to school. Yet, the teachers would ultimately, the next day, get to the bottom of it and everything would be ironed out. All Schwinn bikes looked the same, and such things could happen.\nAnd, I still remember the time when someone took my coat (which looked like theirs) from the restaurant coat room, and my car keys were in it. When they got home, it was discovered. My coat and car keys were returned to the restaurant, and we were eventually able to drive home.\nSo, it is not just with transportation devices but in many situations–when things look the same, complex ramifications can occur!\nTop of Form\nBottom of Form",

      "text": "The Separation Of Church And State\nJul 5, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nIt was drilled into me at an early age that part of being an American was the belief in the separation of Church and State.\nOf course, the foundation of that belief goes back to the earliest history of the country when immigrants came here from Europe to escape religious persecution. That principle was codified in the Constitution of the United States with the words: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof….”\nHaving said that, it worries me that today some are beginning to equate religious affiliation with political party affiliation. “To be a good Christian you need to be a ____.” It doesn’t matter which party you use to fill in the blank, it is a bad idea.\nOne’s religious beliefs should not become equated with what it means to be an American. Not only is it poor politics, it ends up equating a religious belief with an earthly, temporal, secular point-of-view. From a theological standpoint, that can be a form of idolatry.\nThese are round numbers, but in the 17th century during the Thirty Years War largely between Protestants and Catholics, it has been estimated that approximately 20%-25% of the population of Central Europe was killed. Mixing religion with politics can do that.\nIt is no wonder that the founding fathers didn’t want that to happen in America.\nIf you look around the world today, there is still a lot of war going on based, in large part, upon religion…the most prominent example today likely being between Muslim Gaza and Jewish Israel. Now Israel and Iran are involved in a shooting war with our country now also getting involved. Fueling much of this war-making in the Middle East is religious hatred.\nAs an American, I distinguish between Judaism as a religion and Israel as a state. In like manner, being a Palestinian or an Iranian is not the same for me as a religious belief in Islam. Religious beliefs should be separate and distinct from the state.\nYet, because religion and the state are equated in that part of the world, we are now experiencing war there with a level of ferocity and destruction reminiscent of the Second World War.\nPerhaps there is a middle ground when it comes to separating Church and State. In Germany, for example, the government supports both Protestant and Catholic Churches depending upon which part of the country you live in. The general populace accepts that, and Germany goes on about its business of continuing to be a thriving democracy in central Europe essentially ignoring differences in religion by supporting two main branches of Christianity.\nYet, I think the American ideal is a better model to follow…just keep the state and religion separated. Don’t mix them up, or, at least, try not to. That should be our goal.\nWe have enough problems with common humanity in the world in trying to keep our cultural/national/racial identities from taking us to war. We don’t need religion to be another source of war-making.",

      "text": "The Importance Of Esprit De Corps\n sJune 14, 2025\n Rolland Kidder \nThe importance of “esprit de corps” hit me recently as I was watching the workers on the sewer construction job now being built north of Stow on the west side of the lake. These French words refer to team spirit, to people respecting each other and working together for a common purpose.\nThe construction workers on this job work as a team without a lot of shouting or being “bossed” around. They just do their jobs and expect those around them to do the same. It is obvious that they respect each other and like their jobs.\nOne may be on a backhoe, another laying out the route of pipe for the next day, another restoring areas disturbed as the new sewer system is installed–but their effort is quite seamless. It is inspiring to watch.\nIn looking back at my own life experience, it made me recall my first duty assignment as a new Ensign in the U.S. Navy back in 1967. I was assigned to be the Operations Officer on a small ship homebased in Sasebo, Japan.\nIt truly was a small ship by Navy standards…60 men with 6 officers were its contingent. In reflection, though, what really made its smallness significant is that we usually operated alone, not in the company of other ships.\nOur mission required us to work with other allied Navies in that part of the world, so we would travel to places like South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. to do our work…and we would travel alone.\nWe didn’t think much about it then, but the fact that we could travel such long distances without significant help close by was a testament to the commitment of members of the crew to each other and to our dependence upon each other. People knew their jobs, respected each other, and trusted in one another.\nHere I was…a greenhorn, boot Ensign right out of Officer Candidate School and while underway was assigned as an Officer of the Deck on the bridge responsible for the safety and movements of the ship for four hours at a time, often in the middle of the night. But, it wasn’t just me up there on the bridge, there was a duty section consisting of one third of the crew up and working at the same time all over the ship doing their jobs. We were a team. There was an “esprit de corps” in what we were doing.\nI remember one time on that ship when we were caught in what were close to typhoon-force winds while enroute from Taiwan back to our homebase in Japan. The seas were so high that they had the power to roll the ship over. We had to keep the bow of the ship into the oncoming waves to avoid this.\nThe bridge was about 25 ft. above the waterline, and the waves were about 30 ft. in height. Sometimes, for a second or two, the sea would sweep over the bow, and then we would lurch up with the bow nearly out of the water as the ship headed over the crest and then pitched down into the following trough as the next wave approached. It went on like this for about two days.\nIt wasn’t much fun, but we were not alarmed. Everyone was doing their job as a team to ensure that the ship got through. Finally, the storm subsided, and we headed home for Japan unscathed.\nIt only takes about one such time in your life going through something like this to make you realize that your life is dependent upon the lives and work of others. “Esprit De Corps” is real. It is necessary. It is what makes the world work, and we need more of it.",

Because of the power of the Presidency, Democrats in high places essentially “rolled over,” hoped for the best, and didn’t act until it was too late.\nThey erred in so doing, and more viable candidates for the highest office in the land were thus thwarted in seeking that office. To put it bluntly, one of our major political parties failed the country. The power of the Presidency, the power of one — overpowered the traditional political process of the Democratic Party.\nNow, we are compounding the problem by what seems to be the virtual abandonment of the Republican Party in opposing in any way the current President. Members of Congress, when President Trump says “Jump!”–they respond, “How high?!”\nThere appears to be little or no backbone in the Republican Congress when it comes to proposals from the White House. It can be 145% tariffs today, and 30% tariffs tomorrow. It can be taking a gift of half a billion dollars from a sheikh in Arabia so that our President can have a plush airplane with a gilded interior, or have him telling American Universities that they must parrot the messaging of the federal government or be shut down.\nWhatever comes out of the White House now is apparently infallible, and the law of the land is to be set by executive decree.\nHowever you look at it, I see in all of this a demeaning of our constitutional government. The Constitution was written to give the congress, the executive and the courts equal jurisdiction over our affairs as a nation. If any branch of the government was to have a leading role, it was to have been the congress through the power of the purse strings.\nNow we stand in awe, apparently as helpless as sheep, while in the dead of night the House of Representatives rubber stamps the White House by ripping down a great part of the government previously created by other Republican and Democratic administrations to pay for unneeded tax cuts accelerating the deficit. All put altogether in a “one big Beautiful Bill!”–whatever that means.\nI doubt that many members of Congress even knew what was in it. It was too much for at least one Republican member of the House from Long Island who fell asleep that night somewhere in halls of Congress and didn’t wake up for this monumental vote.\nIt seems that maybe the whole country is asleep. When will this end? It has taken over 200 years, through fits and starts, successes and failures, but, for the most part, with good intentions, to build this country making it the leader of the free world.\nNow we seem to be giving it all up to be ruled by a government of one. We shouldn’t be going down this road. This is not what made America great.",

There are jobs that cannot be done at home using only a computer and an internet connection.\nIt is not just dental work; it is most medical work. Patients have to be seen; the sick have to be taken care of. As to teaching, effective education requires that teachers be in a classroom. In the winter, snowplows actually must be operated by snowplow drivers, etc.\nAs to manufacturing, you can’t produce truck engines (think Cummins) without a work force doing it. If you go out to eat, it requires a cook and a waitress. Carpenters are required to build a house. A bridge cannot be rebuilt without the construction workers to do it. And, yes, despite automation, human beings actually have to be involved when cows are being milked.\nNot everything can be done by computer. There is a lot that can’t be done by just asking “Siri” or “Alexa” to do it.\nThe band Alabama has a song which goes right to this point titled “Forty Hour Week For A Livin’.” Here is one verse from those lyrics:\n“This is for the one who drives the big rig\nUp and down the road\nOr the one out in the warehouse\nBringing in the load\nOr the waitress, the mechanic\nThe policeman on patrol\nFor everyone who works behind the scenes\nWith a spirit you can’t replace with no machine.”\nAnd then the song ends with this: “Hello America, let me thank you for your time.”\nSometimes it’s good to reflect on the human requirements that keep our society moving. All of this talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI} and more automation for everything sounds good…but there are tasks that can only be done by our fellow men and women. Even the orders taken and processed by AI, have to be delivered in a cardboard box by someone driving a van who takes the item ordered to the customer.\nAs to 40 hours a week, that is just a wish for many who are working to make ends meet. There are a lot of people working out there behind the scene, that can’t be replaced “with no machine.” We need to be mindful and grateful for that.\nHello, America…let me thank you for your time!",

It is good to have a world leader who brings spiritual perspective and continuity and who is not caught up in the day-to-day political battles that are always occurring between nations around the globe. The Pope, as leader of his church, stands for something more.\nThere was elation in this country that the new Pope was an American. Yet, he is not an American Pope. He is a Pope who was born in America. He is everyone’s Pope. He is the world’s Pope.\nA good friend of mine, who is a strong, committed Catholic, was greatly moved by the selection of Pope Leo XIV. As he put it: “As an Augustinian, and just like Pope Francis, who was a Jesuit, the new Pope took vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. That certainly is a life that I could not follow, and I respect anyone who can follow those vows.”\nIsn’t it heartening that not all leadership in the world is driven by a desire for power or money? We don’t measure a Pope by how big his bank account is or by how many houses he owns. We look to him for spiritual and moral leadership.\nBack in the days when I was a Methodist seminarian in the Chicago area, through ecumenical/inter-school conferences, I came to know some Jesuit seminarians. It gave me a glimpse into the world of the Roman Catholic priesthood.\nIt is a monumental commitment that these men make. Not only do they make a commitment to the Christian ministry, but they must also commit to the celibate life of an all-male priesthood.\nSome of the Catholic seminarians that I met eventually left their training because they had fallen in love and wanted to get married. It has been my view since then that the Catholic Church would be better served if it allowed and recognized a married clergy. There are enough challenges to be confronted by those in the Christian ministry without also saddling them with a mandate that they cannot marry, have kids or raise a family.\nAs a non-Catholic, it is something that someday I hope will change. I believe that it would strengthen and not diminish the Roman Catholic Church.\nBut back to the present–the new Pope seems to be a good choice. He is multi-lingual and spoke in Latin, Italian and Spanish when introduced to the crowd at St. Peter’s Square. He spent 20 years as a missionary in Peru and also holds Peruvian citizenship. Yet, he also still calls Chicago home. He is truly the world’s Pope.\nOur world needs strong spiritual and moral leadership, and it looks like we have that in Pope Leo XIV. The only perceived weakness I can find in him is that he is apparently a White Sox fan, and I have always rooted for the Cubs!",

That local school kids can put on such an exceptional performance combined with all of the choreography and building of stage sets–is a great testament to our system of public education.\nAs a grandparent of kids so involved, it makes me not a disinterested observer. When I go to one of these performances, I am all in. I keep my handkerchief close by as I know that at some point in the performance, I am going to tear up.\nOne aspect of it is that “musicals,” as we know them, are primarily an American phenomenon. They are a Broadway thing. People from all over the world come to New York every year just to experience the latest American musical.\nYou never know what the Broadway crowd is going to cook up. I was especially impressed a few years back when the musical “Hamilton” came out. I thought it would be a flop. How could anyone make a conservative “straight arrow” banker like Alexander Hamilton into a Broadway star? But they did it! It has been one of the biggest hits ever.\nFor the student participants in these local school musicals, the whole experience has to be unforgettable. Our grandson explained it this way:\n“When we first started rehearsing, nobody knew anything about the play, had never heard most of the songs, and many of us had never done a dance routine. We thought we could never pull it off. Then, one day, it hit us–we realized that we actually could do it. Then it all came together.”\nAnd did it ever! The standing ovation at the end, said it all. Handkerchiefs throughout the crowd came out of pockets. You would have thought it was Broadway itself.\nOf course, the unheralded hero in the whole show was the teacher/director who had taken this raw material of untested talent and molded it all into a show. The choreography, the beauty of the stage set, the lighting, the musical accompaniment, the singing–without a director, it wouldn’t have happened.\nThe “Americanness” of it all also hit me. Here we were, in a public school, in an audience coming from all different directions and outlooks, cheering and appreciating what these kids were doing. It was beautiful. You don’t find this happening in many foreign countries.\nSometimes, I find the storyline in these musicals to be a bit hoaky and syrupy. But that doesn’t matter. The power of music combined with a play–outside of opera, there is nothing that compares to it.\nKudos to our schools, kids, teachers, and parents for sponsoring again the Great American Musical!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

      "text": "Can The U.S. Go It Alone?\nLocal Commentaries\nApr 12, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nThere has always been an isolationist streak in American politics. Among others, our first President, George Washington, in his farewell address, cautioned the new nation about becoming entangled in the affairs of other nations.\nBut, the history of our country and the world changed. Whether we liked it or not, we were thrust into world affairs in the twentieth century by both World War I and World War II. America became the leader of the free world. In that capacity, we forged international agreements and alliances to keep the peace.\nWe also encouraged international trade and commerce as a necessary part of keeping nations engaged with each other, instead of making war on each other. There was at least one good outcome to the terrible toll of human life in World War II–we helped rebuild the two enemies we had destroyed, Germany and Japan. They became bulwarks of freedom and democracy and have become strong allies in Europe and the Pacific.\nNow, with the Trump tariffs, we are marching backwards. We are trying to go it alone, to dictate to other countries the terms of trade and commerce. We are building a wall around ourselves. Our message to other nations is clear: “You need us, we don’t need you!” Where will it end?\nWhen the President announced his new tariffs, he referenced a list of many countries and their tariff rates on U.S. goods. One was Bangladesh…one of the poorest countries in the world which he said had a tariff rate of about 80%. Now, the United States, I expect, will impose that same rate on them…a “reciprocal” tariff.\nWhat does this mean? It obviously doesn’t mean that we will sell more cars or much of anything else to Bangladesh. However, it does mean that the United States will now put an 80% tax on consumer goods like clothing, T-shirts, etc. that come from Bangladesh. Who gets hurt? Not Bangladesh…but Americans who wear T-shirts and other clothes manufactured there.\nBrilliant – talk about shooting yourself in the foot. It is primarily Americans who are going to foot the bill for Trump’s tariffs.\nBut, what to me is more worrisome, is the attitude of arrogance being displayed by our country. “It is our way or the highway. Get out of the way if you don’t like it!” What a way to win friends and influence people around the world.\nPerhaps, the most egregious treatment that has been dished out by this administration is upon Canada and Canadians…next door neighbors and longstanding friends of ours. They too are supposed to get in line and follow us over the cliff we have created. If they continue to object by banning American whiskey from their shelves, good for them. Maybe it will wake up some people in Washington… or at least those who represent Kentucky.\nGoing it alone is not the American way. We are on a bad path right now.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "The World Through A Windshield\nLocal Commentaries\nApr 5, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nThere is a country song about a trucker on the road who is “looking at the world through a windshield.”\nIt has made me think, over the years, that in actuality…we all see life through a windshield. The way we were brought up, what we were taught, where we were born–all of it is a “windshield” through which we see and understand the world.\nI think it is this “windshield” which makes it so hard to comply with the golden rule… “love thy neighbor as thyself.” Trying to see the world through someone else’s eyes is not easy.\nJust think about the war-torn areas of the world today. Your “windshield” is a lot different if you suffered through this past winter in Gaza versus living in Israel, or if you are in the trenches of Ukraine or trying to attack those trenches as a soldier for Russia. It is hard to apply the golden rule in such situations.\nIn thinking back to my own childhood, my view of life was pretty much shaped by the experiences of growing up on a dairy farm in Chautauqua County. The “city kids” that I knew and palled around with lived in the City of Jamestown. That was what “city” meant to me. It wasn’t until I got to Chicago, after college, that I really found out what urban living was all about.\nProbably the biggest eye-opener for me as to seeing “life through a windshield” came with the years that I was in the Navy. It was here that I came in contact with men from all over the country. When you work on a daily basis with people coming from such diverse places as New York City to rural Texas…you soon become aware that your own “windshield” is a fairly small prism.\nThe fact that we no longer have a military draft has, in my opinion, accelerated the sense of division and separateness that now characterizes the country. We are no longer thrown into the melting pot of military service where we are exposed to people and views from across the land.\nI also remember the false hope that somehow the availability of the internet would bring about a sense that we lived in a global village of some kind. Instead, the internet and television have made it easier to get into our “caves” or “cocoons” where we get our news or can communicate in echo chambers with only like-minded people.\nHumanity, of course, is always going to have differences based on race, ethnicity, country of origin and political opinion dependent on the structures of government we have known. We cannot overlook these differences.\nBut, it is important that we realize and understand that those differences create a “windshield” through which we see the world.\nThe truck driver rolling down the road realizes that not only is he seeing the world through a windshield…so is everyone else on the road.\nWith that realization comes humility. We are not the “only pebble on the beach.” There are billions of other human beings out there seeing the world through their own “windshields.” Understanding that, I think, may be the beginning of wisdom.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "In Defense of Chuck Schumer\nLocal Commentaries\nMar 29, 2025\nRolland Kidder\nOur U.S. Senator, Chuck Schumer, has come under some fairly heavy criticism in the past couple of weeks over his decision to not let the government default.\nThe criticisms were framed primarily by those in his own party who believed that the decision would further enable the President in his efforts at dismantling the federal government. This impression was magnified when the President, himself, thanked Schumer for lending support to the Continuing Resolution (CR) to keep the government running through September.\nI am not entirely a disinterested observer in all of this, since many years ago I served with Senator Schumer when he was an Assemblyman in the New York State Assembly. While there, and in his subsequent roles in the Congress of the United States, I have found him to be honest and pragmatic in his approach to government. He also, despite having had big responsibilities in Washington, has paid attention to his Upstate New York constituents and visits each county of the state every year.\nBut, to get back to Senator Schumer’s decision to support the CR, I thought it made both substantive and political sense. Substantively, a government shutdown on top of all of the chaos associated with the dismantling of government and layoffs that have been going on under the leadership of the President and Elon Musk would have been devastating for the country.\nOn the political side of things, though more liberal members of his party wanted him to stand up to Trump and shut down the government, Schumer made the pragmatic decision that to do that would just heap political criticism on the Democrats. A shutdown would have given Republicans, who now control the levers of power in Washington, an easy scapegoat to blame Democrats for the additional chaos which would have followed with even more negative consequences.\nSchumer saw through that and did his party and his country a favor by supporting passage of a bill in the Senate to keep the government running – though I am sure there was lot in it that he didn’t like\nIn my view, it took political courage for Schumer to do this. He is taking some short-term political flack for his position, but, in the long-run, it was the right and smart thing to do both politically and for the country.\nChuck Schumer, unlike the President, has a long history in and knowledge of how government works. In truth, government has an important role to play in our society. Sometimes it can overreach and become bloated, but what it does is address needs that the private sector does not or cannot do – like public safety, public infrastructure, a court system, public schools, food and meat inspection, environmental standards, healthcare support, running a National Park Service, maintaining roads and bridges, funding social security and the military and all of the other myriad of things that we take for granted in this great country of ours.\nSo, Senator Schumer, thanks for standing up and doing the right thing. You may be getting criticism from some quarters, but, for what it’s worth, your stock is still strong up here, in that part of the state north and west of the Tappan Zee Bridge – that demarcation line south of which lies the great majority of this state’s residents and voters.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

If it were done in school, the teacher would send the student involved to the principal’s office.\nActually, it was more than bullying. President Zelensky was bushwhacked between the two hammering voices of President Trump and Vice-President Vance. This was no spontaneous, unplanned event. They were out to surprise and crush the Ukrainian President in a coordinated way.\nAs an American, I was ashamed and embarrassed.\nTo Trump though, it was a victory. “This is going to be great television,” he said. An observation that fits with his general “modus operandi.”\nWhen Tony Schwarz ghost-wrote in 1987 the book “Art of the Deal” for Trump, the publisher showed Mr. Trump a copy of what the proposed book would look like. Trump liked it, did not comment on its content, but said: “Please make my name much bigger.” That was done on the cover, and the book became a bestseller.\nThe same Donald Trump, our current President, now in his first chaotic days of a second term, seems to be consistent, at least on that point. Even if the news is not good, as long as the Trump name gets top billing, it is a success.\nAs Schwarz said in a follow-up interview after the book was published, Trump “seemed driven entirely by a need for public attention.” After spending decades as a tabloid titan, “the only thing left was running for President. If he could run for emperor of the world, he would.”\nAs to that ambition, unfortunately, the President may be in for a surprise. The world is not ready for an emperor, even an American emperor. We have to hope that others in the world will arise to remind us of our democratic roots and help steer us back in the direction of responsible, representative government.\nThe Roman philosopher, Seneca, once wrote: “Caesar and the state are one and the same.” It was opposition to that kind of thinking that brought America into being. We didn’t want Caesar or the King of England running this country.\nWhen asked what kind of government the Constitutional Convention had proposed, Ben Franklin is purported to have said: “A Republic if you can keep it.” Now is a time when we need to be focused on “keeping it.”\nBullying a beleaguered leader of a country that was invaded and is fighting for its life as a democracy is not the American way.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a former New York state Assemblyman.\nTop of Form",

The party also advocated for a bi-partisan foreign policy encouraging strong relationships with our allies through alliances like NATO in order to contain Russian aggression.\nNow all that seems to be gone. “We are the great United States, we are bigger and smarter than any other nation, and we will tell the world what to do. International leaders and members of military alliances which we helped create need to understand that we are now the boss.”\nAnd, as to free trade, especially here in North America: “Forget about free trade agreements. The United States is going to slap a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico, unless they do exactly what we tell them to do.”\nTeddy Roosevelt, who, I believe, everyone would concede was a strong and outspoken President–exercised American power by “speaking softly but carrying a big stick.” Now, we speak loudly, brandish the big stick, and tell other countries that we will act for our own benefit regardless of what they think.\nAll of this is sad to me. This is not the America I grew up with. This is not making America great again. It is the way of banana republics and autocrats.\nAnd, the idea that a clown like Elon Musk, can come into the government with a “meat axe” approach and actually know what he is cutting…is a joke. Apparently, it doesn’t matter that the United States Agency for International Development was created and supported by both Republican and Democratic parties in the past. Now, in the name of government efficiency, it is to be abolished by fiat from Elon Musk and the White House.\nWhat about the program instituted by President George W. Bush to combat the epidemic of AIDS throughout the world? What about food programs when there are famines? Are not American farmers still the “bread-basket” of the world? Does America not care anymore?\nEliminating some programs because they are wasteful or inefficient could be understood, but eliminating an entire agency created by the Congress to address such issues… is just plain wrong.\nThe GOP now seems to have only one mantra…and that is “follow the leader.” Whatever he says goes. Wherever he leads us, we will follow. It reminds me of the Pied Piper leading a mesmerized crowd over the cliff.\nMuch of this new approach to government seems to be driven by inflaming fear and discord. Fear has always been an easy sell. Yet, driving wedges between people and nations has not been the American way.\nWhere it will all end, we don’t know.\nOne bright spot came last week, when a federal prosecutor with strong Republican credentials, quit her job in the Southern District of New York rather than follow orders from Washington to stop criminal charges against the Mayor of the City of New York. She viewed such orders as blatantly illegal and a violation of legal and judicial ethics.\nThis is what it will take to turn things around. People, like her, will have to stand up to officials in high places when they are leading us in the wrong direction.",

But, I will have to admit, that I was cheering on the Eagles … primarily because a local guy and graduate of Southwestern Central School was coaching them.\nI have never met Nick Sirianni, but you felt like you got to know him with all of the press coverage leading up to the big event. Locally, he will be honored this year as an inductee to the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame, joining his father and two brothers who are already there.\nOne interesting fact is that Nick Sirianni and Andy Reid, coach of the Chiefs, have at least one thing in common–they have both been head coach of the Eagles. After being fired by the Eagles, Reid went on to his illustrious career at Kansas City. Two years ago, Reid’s team defeated Philadelphia in the Super Bowl…but not this year.\nSirianni appears to have one characteristic that helped him out in getting his team to the Super Bowl–he doesn’t get rattled by bad press. Early in the season, he had actually been booed by some Philadelphia fans because the team had lost two games.\nSirianni didn’t cave…he doubled down. He knew that he had a good team. He reiterated that to his players, and they turned their season around. Getting sports teams to believe in each other is half the battle in winning. That is what good coaches understand.\nOf course, locally, there were many stories written about Sirianni, his family and his growing up around here.\nI had not known, for example, that he was a childhood friend of Tom Langworthy, the football coach at JHS. There was a terrific story of how Langworthy could beat Sirianni in ping-pong–and, when it happened, Sirianni would slam down his paddle. He didn’t like losing, even at ping-pong.\nThe winning coach of the Super Bowl also has a large family presence here. His Mom and Dad are long-time residents, his brother coaches football at Southwestern, and his nieces and nephew are student athletes there.\nTo top it off, it was terrific that a guy born in Jamestown, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, would present the Vince Lombardy Trophy to another guy born and raised around here–Nick Sirianni. It doesn’t get better than that, even if you are a Bill’s fan.\nAs to the Bills, maybe we “dodged a bullet” in losing to the Chiefs this year in the playoffs. The way the Eagles were playing in the Super Bowl, I doubt that any team could have beaten them… and the Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback are not just “any team.”\nSo, Nick Sirianni, congratulations on your great win! You deserved it, are a credit to your sport, and we are proud that you came from this community and remain close to your family and friends who live here!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

Apparently, mother nature doesn’t care if you are a Republican or a Democrat when you are getting old.\nNancy Pelosi, the Democrat, who is my age, fell on some stairs at a palace in Luxembourg where she was commemorating with other members of Congress the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. Some say that she tripped because she still wears spike heels…but that, as far as I know, has not been confirmed.\nThe Republican who has made similar news is Senator Mitch McConnell who fell in the Senate and apparently bruised his head and face pretty badly. McConnel has been in the news over the past year with other slip-ups attributed to his advancing age.\nSo, just to re-emphasize…aging is not partial to your political affiliation.

He just keeps marching on and includes everybody.\nSome in my family think that I shouldn’t write about getting old…but I sort of look at it as an obligation. Older people can learn from others going through it, and younger people might benefit by knowing what is coming.\nThere is nothing wrong with aging. Everyone ages. But, not everyone wants to deal with or embrace its reality. We were meant to age.\nAlso, I have never met anyone who is getting older who at one time wasn’t younger. This may sound a bit like a Yogi Berra quote, but it is the truth.\nA reverse way to state it is: “old bones don’t get young.” I am living proof of that. When you are my age, over 80–it is probably time to give up some things…like downhill skiing on black diamond slopes.\nWhen my parents were this age, nobody had ever heard of knee, hip or shoulder replacements. Now, it is uncommon when you don’t know somebody who has just gone through one or is scheduled for surgery to have a new joint implanted somewhere in their body.\nThe “fool’s gold,” of course, in having this done is that the new, artificial joints are being added to old bones. A “new” hip or knee may well improve your mobility and reduce pain. But, be not fooled–they are not the only things wearing down in your body.\nI have repeated before in this column advice from my doctor who always tells me when I have a physical exam: “Just slow down and live within yourself!”\nNot bad advice, I would say, for all Republicans or Democrats who have been around for seven or eight decades. Mother nature is totally bipartisan.

He had quietly lived for many years in Florida in his retirement. He was no longer “making waves” in this community...though, at one time, he had made many.\nIt doesn’t take long for memories to fade. As Alfred Lord Tennyson once poignantly wrote: “The old order changeth, yielding place to new.” \nBut, one advantage in being old, like me, is that I still have vivid memories. I can tell you of being a kid five years old and celebrating the end of World War II in downtown Jamestown where the car horns were blaring, people were partying in the street and kids were yelling “the war is over, the war is over!”\nI can reminisce about growing up on a dairy farm, milking cows and working with my Dad on the farm.\nAnd, I can still remember some of the “movers and shakers” in Jamestown. One of those was Paul Bush.\nWhen I first met Paul, he was an up-and-coming businessman from Little Valley who had inherited a family business and was bringing new life into it. You could probably call him an “interloper” as he wasn’t born and raised in Chautauqua County. He was a “Catt. County guy.”\nYet, to Chautauqua County he came, along with the vision of creating a company to manufacture “ready to assemble” furniture. The county offered him a site for a new factory in the Mason Industrial Park. He endorsed the idea and came.\nOn the day that the financing was finalized to make the new factory possible, Paul was playing golf with a friend of mine at Moonbrook. They were on # 7 green, and a golf cart came speeding up with a couple of bankers yelling and screaming to Paul... “we got the financing, we got the financing!”\nPaul thanked them for the news, and, after they left, he turned to his playing partner and said: “I don’t know if I should be smiling or crying. Now, we can build a business, but we also have the bankers to pay.”\nWell, he did build that business, and it was very successful. There are now new owners of the business, but Bush Industries continues as a significant employer in the area. Think of all the people employed and the economic good that has been done for our county over the past 40 years. \nPaul was always generous, and many still remember the 4th of July parties at his home in Lakewood. Sometimes, when called upon, he would contribute financially to ensure that there would be the annual fireworks display in the village.\nPerhaps his greatest contribution to the community was the day that he gifted the Jamestown Tennis Center to the YMCA. Without that gift, there would not be the Lakewood YMCA that we now enjoy.\nGoodbye, old friend. You did a lot of good here in this community. You will be greatly missed.\n[photo] \n11961447.pdf\nPaul S. Bush\nMay 5, 1936 – January 22, 2025",

I guess the difference this time is that personal loyalty seems paramount over experience and more political appointees are coming from the news/entertainment business.\nThat, in itself, should not be a surprise, as the President-elect himself came from that job sector. Yet, in his first administration he tended to nominate people for positions like Secretary of Defense who actually had the experience and knowledge for the job.\nThis is not meant to bash the President-elect on all of his appointments. For example, a western Governor from the State of North Dakota has been nominated to run the Interior Department. The federal government controls/owns a lot of property in the West, so this nominee has had first-hand knowledge and experience in dealing with the Department of the Interior.\nA former Congressman and candidate for Governor in New York has been nominated to run the EPA. Though not noted as an environmental protection guy, he comes from a part of the country where environmental policy has a big impact. He is smart, has held public office and should be able to do the job. The fact that he endorsed Mr. Trump is not disqualifying…this is the way of American politics.\nBut, that brings us to Hulk Hogan who, as far as I know, is still a rough and tumble ex-wrestler. He made a big appearance at the Republican Convention and is close to the President. Where would he fit in? Perhaps, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be a good fit.\nAnother factor about HHS is that it is proposed to be headed up by Robert Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, who is known for having some half-baked ideas about healthcare. Kennedy is going to have his hands full and will need guidance in running this department of about 80,000 people. Maybe Hulk Hogan is the man who can provide the needed advice.\nI expect though that Hogan’s most likely landing spot will be at the Department of Education which is supposed to be headed by the former CEO of WWE. Sports as entertainment has likely been overlooked as an educational priority by the federal government and Hogan could fix that.\nEnough speculation. “To the victor belong the spoils.” The Senate now has the job of vetting cabinet members and various other appointees.\nThe political campaign is over. Vice President Harris participated in the certification proceedings affirming Donald Trump to be the winner in the electoral college. No one tried to interfere in the process, and no one was breaking into the Capitol… like we had four years ago.\nThe Republicans had a big election. They now have the responsibility of governing.

      "text": "Jimmy Carter: A Life Well-Lived\nLocal Commentaries\nJan 4, 2025\nRolland Kidder \nAmerica lost an icon this past week…Jimmy Carter. In many ways, he was an anomaly in our national politics–a peanut farmer who came from nowhere to win the Presidency.\nWhen I say “nowhere,” I do not mean to disrespect the people of Plains, Georgia. But, even people from Plains would never have predicted it. To bring it close to home, it would be like someone from around here predicting that Robert Jackson from Frewsburg, N.Y. would become a U.S. Attorney General, Supreme Court Justice and Chief American Prosecutor at Nuremberg.\nThese things just don’t happen very often.\nWhat drew me to Carter, I expect, is just that fact–he came from the kind of rural background that I grew up in. He was what, in New York, we would call an “upstate Democrat,” and both he and his wife, Rosalynn, came and campaigned here in Western New York.\nIn the process, in 1980, I became a Carter delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Though his prospects for re-election didn’t look good at the time, I believed that he personified the kind of human being that we should want to have in the White House. The fact that he lost that election, has never changed my mind as to the genuine humility, kindness and goodness of this man.\nA lot of things can cost people elections, but character was not one of them as far as Jimmy Carter was concerned. He was smart, strong, and, sometimes, could be a stubborn man. He was also a person of faith. He not only taught Sunday School, but he believed that the principles he was teaching there should be carried out in real life.\nAfter the Presidency, these attributes magnified themselves. His involvement in the early days of Habitat for Humanity is a case in point. One commentator called it “the theology of the hammer.” It wasn’t good enough just to be a Christian in church. You had an obligation to serve others and to work for their benefit in the wider world.\nRecent comments on his passing may well remain true–that he may be the only President whose high office was a stepping-stone to something perhaps more significant. Carter could have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize just for his work as President in forging peace in the Middle East between Egypt and Israel. But, the Nobel award was also based on his post-Presidency efforts through the Carter Center in advancing health, peace and democratic initiatives throughout the world.\nDuring the time I was involved in Washington with the World War II Memorial, I became good friends with one of Carter’s former staff leaders in the White House, Frank Moore.\nAfter serving in the White House, Frank and his colleague, Jody Powell, stayed in the Washington area and purchased some property on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake. For 25 or 30 years, the former President would come there late in the fall for duck hunting. Carter, the country boy from Georgia, loved the out-of-doors and was a sportsman at heart. Yet, it was also the camaraderie of the hunt, and the personal friendships that surrounded it that really made it special.\nFrank and the former President became good friends during those times. In 2002, Frank and Nancy Moore were invited by the Carter’s to accompany them to Oslo where Carter would receive the Nobel Prize.\nFrank told me that in the week or two preceding his death, the former President remained cognizant and responsive. Rosalynn Carter died last year. She and Jimmy had been married for 77 years. As the end drew near, Jimmy Carter told those caring for him that he was ready to die and “wanted to be with Rosalynn.”\nHis prayer was granted. He is at peace now.\nJimmy Carter…a life well-lived.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form",

It was a well-crafted, articulate analysis by the Prime Minister as to where the world order was going under Trump’s leadership.\nPerhaps, the nub of that speech came when Carney warned that the United States was now leading the world not into a “transition” to a new international system of governance but to a “rupture” in what we have come to know since World War II as a system defined by the rule of law.\nCarney’s speech was not one of grievance, but one of stating the reality of what has been going on since Trump became President in 2025. The President of the United States has not only thrown Canada “under the bus,” he has openly criticized most of America’s former allies in one way or another.\nNoteworthy in Mr. Carney’s speech was that he didn’t stop at just describing the situation as he sees it, he offered a new approach—that it was time for the “middle powers” in the world, like Canada, to seek new alliances between themselves to insure that democracy and the rule of law continue as the basis for international diplomacy.\nThe existing established order, which came out of World War II and was led by the United States, created international institutions and alliances to keep the peace. That order is now being shredded, and the world can no longer count on the United States as it has in the past. Canada and other democracies are adapting to this new reality. \nAs an American, though I appreciated the brilliance and truthfulness of the Prime Minister’s speech—it was a sad day. The Trump administration’s “go-it-alone” foreign policy now being applied with an arrogance that we have never seen—has marginalized the United States on the world stage.\nThe Prime Minister of Canada spoke truth to power. We are forcing our former allies to find new ways to keep the peace in order to preserve democracy in the world—what could be more tragic? Our “go it alone,” America first (and only, it seems) strategy is destroying the credibility of the United States of America.\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

But, last week, the House of Representatives acted…avoiding a federal government shutdown.\nThe last-minute vote wasn’t a total surprise, since tough votes are often not taken until deadlines are nearing. Yet, what made this one especially special is that, as first proposed, it was attacked by incoming President Donald Trump and his new surrogate, Elon Musk.\nNo one knows what will happen with Speaker Mike Johnson when the new Congress convenes. Because of the messy way in which this needed legislation ultimately passed, he may incur the wrath of Mr. Trump and not be re-elected Speaker of the House.\nOn the other hand, members of the House might again select him as their leader. The bare Republican majority in the new Congress, makes it even more difficult for the House to operate with just Republican votes. Despite being criticized for it, Speaker Johnson reached across the aisle for Democratic votes when that became necessary to keep the government running.\nThe big “bugaboo,” of course, in all of this, is the national debt. Congressmen and Presidents love to spend money though they don’t often like to raise the taxes necessary to pay for it. Debt financing is easier. This means that the national debt keeps going up, and that has meant that Congress has to keep raising the debt ceiling.\nMr. Trump has, from reports, suggested doing away with the debt ceiling altogether. That would give him (and any President) carte blanche power to take deficit spending to any level that they would want. Congress, rightly, wants to retain some control over the purse strings, and they should. That role is given to them in the Constitution.\nA subplot in all of this is the part that Elon Musk will play in the new administration. He publicly supported Mr. Trump in the election and poured a lot of money into his campaign. At one rally, Mr. Trump, in introducing him said: “A new star is born, Elon Musk!”\nYet, Mr. Trump is also well known for not playing “second fiddle” to anyone. Musk needs to be careful and not overplay his hand.\nAlso, Musk is not known for listening to others even in his own business dealings. Working with the U.S. Congress is something he has never done. When it comes to politicians on Capitol Hill, he will be dealing with a different breed of cat. Members of Congress have been directly elected by the people. Congress has its own role to play and will not easily be pushed aside.\nI have a hunch, but it is just a hunch, that Mike Johnson might actually survive and be re-elected Speaker in the new Congress. He is a likeable guy and seems to have fewer political enemies than many other potential candidates.\nA big fight to select a new Speaker would also likely result in a non-functioning House of Representatives, as we saw two years ago when it took weeks to elect a Speaker. The winner of that particular contest, Kevin McCarthy, lasted only a few months before being ousted.\nWe need the House of Representatives to fulfill its role under the Constitution. There is little to be gained for the country if Congress again falls into chaos over electing a leader.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

This has been the case where some, alleging that it would improve the environment, have been pushing to stop the use of all natural gas in our state.\nJust think what that would mean? The largest source of the energy now generating electricity in the state would be cut-off. The cleanest fossil fuel that we have would be shut down. And, if you live in a place like Western New York, you would have to find a new way to heat your home. In Albany, even the Capitol would go cold.\nThis anti-natural gas policy is nonsense. Not only is it bad public policy, it would devastate the state and cripple the electric grid if these policies were to be carried out.\nI would characterize New York State as being duplicitous and two-faced on the issue. In the name of cleaning up the environment, we abolished the ability to explore and produce natural gas in the state. The DEC won’t give permits anymore to drill and explore for natural gas to allow for drilling in the shale, which is an immense resource in the state, especially in the Southern Tier.\nOn the other hand, our state, including counties downstate and the City of New York, continue to consume great quantities of natural gas. As the old saying goes: “We want to have our cake and eat it to,” though in this case it is natural gas we are talking about. Though we won’t produce it, we want others to do so and send it to us for our energy needs.\nWhat keeps the lights on in New York City right now is that there are still some old natural gas peaking plants which get turned on, on very cold days or on hot summer days when the air-conditioning load is high and more electricity is required.\nWe could have more efficient peaking plants in New York City, but “No,” that would violate our state-imposed mandate to stop using natural gas. So, we keep using the old, less efficient gas turbine peaking plants. All in the name of cleaning up the environment.\nSuch policies are, of course, nuts…but, it happens, here in New York!\nAnd, what about installing a natural gas generator so that you can have power in your house if the electrical grid does fail? I expect that the “deep thinkers” in Albany and New York will soon find a way to try and stop that as well.\nThe ultimate reality for me, of course, comes here at home. Our furnace and hot water are heated by natural gas. Gas is a much more efficient fuel in producing heat than electricity…but who cares about that?\nThen there is the fact that a few years ago, we put in a small but very efficient natural gas stove. My back has gotten older and no longer wants to stoke a wood stove. But now, at least, I have the alternative of putting my feet up, putting the recliner back, pushing a button and then watching a beautiful blue flame heat the room and most of the house.\nThey are “barking up the wrong tree” when they start threatening to take natural gas away. More people are starting to understand that, though, I expect, it will take a few more elections and some energy interruptions before the situation ultimately gets turned around.\nSomeday, they may find a way to transport hydrogen or some other fuel safely to my home. But, in the meantime, I am sticking with the blue flame!",

He said to them: “I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”\nIt is hard not to feel that way on Thanksgiving.\nI remember how tough it was on all of us during COVID time when we couldn’t get together. We were back to full-normal this year with 22 gathered for the big day. I have been married into this family now for over 50 years and every Thanksgiving, and every year on this day, I remember those words of Gehrig.\nThanksgiving is a national holiday and for good reason. But, for me it has always been the biggest family day of the year. It is bigger than birthdays, anniversaries or virtually anything else.\nI savor it, relish it, can’t wait for it to arrive and am sad when it is over. No gift giving, no great expectations, just enjoying and observing the family and finding out what everyone is doing.\nWe were at our son’s home in Skaneateles, New York this year–and the town always has a Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving. You can jog or just walk. This year it was snowing…a wet, slushy, yucky kind of snow. But, that didn’t matter. The townspeople gathered as usual along with out-of-towners like us. Somebody passed the hat for the food bank in town, there were drinks and coffee, nobody was in a sour mood. Good feelings all around. Thanksgiving.\nBack at home, before we left, there had been wonderful gestures leading up to the big day. The newspaper had reported on some churches and others having organized an effort to provide Thanksgiving dinners to those less fortunate. It is heartening to see all of this happening each year.\nAt our Thanksgivings, the family sort of has a nonstop spontaneous discussion going on of what the past year has produced…the good and the bad, but mostly about the good. This year, the biggest news was that our oldest granddaughter is pregnant, and people were speculating about how this new addition would be the center of attention next year.\nWriters can sometimes be redundant, but when it comes to Thanksgiving–I don’t care. Every year I get carried away and write about it. But, it is worth the write.\nThanksgiving always brings me back to what Lou Gehrig said. He is not alone.

We had been out of town, at one of our kids’ homes for the holiday. We drove back on Saturday in good weather and found two feet of snow in our driveway.\nFortunately, it had been plowed thanks to the snowplow guy.\nWe tend to forget about what winter around here is like. We have had some easy ones, and, with four-wheel drive, you begin to think that you can drive through anything. Then comes the lake-effect snow. Thank God for the man who plows our driveway!\nThink though about what his life is like. He can’t take off for the week-end, unless he has a buddy who will fill in for him. He has to be ready to go at almost a moment’s notice. The weather man/woman is better at predicting the weather than they were years ago…thanks to the predictability of computer-generated weather modeling. But, still, around here, in snow country with lake effect snow…a lot of it can fall in a short time without a lot of notice.\nThen, think also of the investment. Snow plows today are not just an “up or down” relatively cheap mechanical machine. They have hydraulic controls which can collapse the plow into the form of a “V”, or direct on which side of the road to push the snow. And, the plow must be ready to go all winter even if there is not a lot of snow.\nThen, there is the “time of day” question. Who wants to get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and start plowing driveways so that others can get up and go to work at 6 or 7 a.m.? That takes a special kind of person.\nYou can’t stay up ’til midnight and watch the late show, and then think you can jump in your truck and start plowing three or four hours later. Like everyone else, the snowplow guy needs his sleep.\nI grew up on a dairy farm and got used to getting up early to milk cows. On snowy days, after milking, we would plow the driveway. In those days we had a tractor with chains on it with a simple “up and down” plow to push the snow. The driveway needed to be plowed so that the milk hauler could get to the milkhouse to pick up the milk cans.\nI don’t milk cows anymore, but I am still an early riser and need to be plowed out. I know that Hogan’s Hut will open at 6 a.m. and I want to be there soon thereafter to buy the morning paper.\nSo sorry, Mr. Snowplow Driver. I am one of those guys that probably makes your life miserable in the early morning hours after a snowy night. Yet, I do appreciate what you do. Thanks for sticking around town, getting up early and doing your work so that the rest of us can travel and go on our way!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

(You may remember him as the guy who unsuccessfully challenged Kathy Hochul in the primary for Governor.)\nSuozzi’s advice as to Presidential appointments was as follows: “Let’s look at what they’re proposing to do and their background, and let the Senate go through their process of vetting these candidates so that they can decide whether or not to give their advice and consent to these appointments. I want to tell everybody, you know, calm down.”\nI thought Suozzi’s advice was good. You may not like some of these proposed appointments, but the election is over and now we must let the process play itself out.\nThe Senate has already rejected the President’s first pick for Attorney General, Matt Gaetz, without even having a hearing. Five Republican Senators knew enough about him to tell the President… “don’t even send his name up here.” Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration.\nWe all have our “wish-list” when it comes to our President. My “wish” for this and every other President has been that they appoint strong, independent-minded people to top jobs. The best example is probably Abraham Lincoln. He appointed a Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary both of whom had opposed him for the Republican nomination. He appointed a Democrat as Secretary of War.\nWhen you are President, you need strong leadership around you so that you are not surrounded by only “yes men” (or women.) You need people who will speak truth to power. Unfortunately, people who are close to power tend to tell their boss what they think he/she wants to hear. This is not helpful in a place like the White House.\nWe know that the President-elect has not, as yet, recommended any of his opponents in this last campaign for cabinet positions. But, there is nothing we can do about that.\nSuozzi has it right. Don’t get all worked up over something you can’t control. Calm down. Let the Senate do its job. The election is over. On we go!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

One of my kids recently attended his 30th anniversary of graduating from high school. Those friendships from years ago are still strong, and several from his class now live around here. We live in a place that nourishes a sense of home.\nYes, you can go live in the “hot spots” of the country like New York or L.A.–but there is nothing like home.\nThe schools here are also good, the cost of housing is less, and you don’t have to drive in traffic for an hour to get somewhere.\nWe also are not a social or educational desert. We have colleges, libraries and centers for the arts, education, law, comedy and culture. Plus, we are only a little more than an hour away from Bills Stadium!\nIn a bit over two hours, you can be in Cleveland…in three, you can be in Toronto.\nAs to the job market–yes, we don’t have as many choices here. But, that is also changing as people become able to work more from home. We do have high speed cable and fiber optic lines…the internet works fine here!\nThere is another factor that I believe will be working in our favor as time goes on…and that is climate.\nWe don’t have to live inside an air-conditioned space most of the year. We can feel the cool breezes of the evening coming through our windows at night. And, despite our long winters, we have a pretty calm climate. Our lights don’t go out for weeks at a time because of hurricanes.\nAnd, though not exactly weather-related, we live on high ground. Worried about floods? Not so much around here. Our people live from between 700 ft. above sea level along Lake Erie to over 2,000 feet on the Allegheny foothills south of Frewsburg. The water all flows downhill from here!\nI see things gradually changing. Where can I go for good affordable schools? Where can I live to enjoy the out-of-doors? Where can I put down roots where the grocery store and shopping is only a short drive away? Where can I live and make life-long friends?\nAnd, where can I live where a rising sea level is not a threat at all? Try living around here. You’ll like it!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "At Last, The Election Is Over\nLocal Commentaries\nNov 9, 2024\nRolland Kidder\nIt seems like eons ago when Joe Biden was still a candidate, and the election seemed over. After the June debate, it was clear that he could no longer articulate and lead a campaign for the Presidency.\nBiden eventually stepped aside, and endorsed his Vice President, Kamala Harris, to be the nominee in his stead. After that, we again had an election going on in the country.\nIt has been an exhausting one. Just this past week, I read a news article full of advice from a psychiatrist as to how people should deal with election angst. Now, I expect that same person is providing advice as to how supporters of Harris should deal with post-election depression.\nYet, remember, fair and free elections are central to our democracy. The silver lining for every American is that we have just undertaken another one. Some may not like the result, but all should rejoice in the fact that we had an election…and a vigorous one at that.\nMy own view is that Harris acquitted herself well. In the time that she had, she was able to make a case for why she should be the next President.\nThere were two major things, out of her control, that I believe contributed to her defeat. First, she didn’t have a lot of time to organize and establish a campaign. President Biden waited too long, until just weeks before the Democratic Convention, before stepping aside.\nThe second strike against her was inflation. Though the economy is now humming along, people are still upset about inflation…especially the rise in food and housing prices. The party in power always gets blamed for that, as was the case this time around.\nWe must also not forget that she was also running against an incumbent. Donald Trump is a former President. He has his own way of campaigning and is effective at it.\nAn old Republican friend contacted me about a week before the election asking who I thought would win the election. Though I sided with Harris, my response to him was: “It is still Trump’s and for him to lose.” I had no scientific basis for making that statement, except for my “gut” reaction and years of experience watching and being involved in elected politics.\nDespite my dislike of his divisive approach to politics and the way he demeans his opponents, you have to admit that Donald Trump is skillful in the public arena. As one columnist said: “He bonds with supporters in an intimate, spontaneous, confessional way, unlike typical politicians….”\nNow, we must hope for the best. We have seen him in action before. What will now happen with Ukraine and the Middle East? Will he go after his political enemies? Maybe… and we can hope… he will want to leave a legacy of positive accomplishment for his final term as President of the United States. We want our Presidents to succeed, not fail.\nThe election is over. It was not “stolen” either this time or the last time. Harris has conceded and congratulated Mr. Trump. There will be a peaceful transition of power. The people have spoken. The decision has been made. Democracy has worked its way once again. We move on from here.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

That church has been here forever it seems, at least in my memory.\nThough the decision is being appealed, it was just one of many churches being closed by the Diocese of Western New York consolidating them with other local parishes.\nThough it came as a “surprise,” it really shouldn’t have. Church attendance has been falling throughout Christendom, especially in the old, established Christian denominations that are spread out across our country.\nThe crisis has displayed itself not only in declining church attendance, but in the decline in the ranks of the clergy. There are fewer priests and pastors being ordained to undertake the important work of leading congregations. As one communicant put it to me: “We used to have a monsignor, two priests and two or three nuns in our church. Now, we are sharing one priest between two or more churches. It is sad.”\nI should quickly add that these sentiments not only apply to Catholic churches, but to most of what in Protestantism have been called “mainline churches.” Attendance at traditional Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran and similar such churches has also been shrinking.\nSome more conservative churches may be holding their own, but, in general, even there, church attendance and membership in America is on the decline.\nI have heard that the problem was greatly accelerated by the COVID pandemic. Gatherings of all kinds were cut back then, and in the case of many churches, attendance has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.\nI write these reflections not because I have any great insight or way to turn this around. But, to me, it is sad. I can remember the day when the Latin Mass was said in the Catholic Church and the church was full, and when at least one service each week was preached in Swedish at some of the Lutheran churches in town. Kids went to catechism or confirmation classes after school – it was a part of our upbringing.\nIt wasn’t a perfect system but through it, you learned about values, morals and humility… standards established under the watchful eye of a creator as taught in the Church. Such teachings were a part of the social fabric in our communities.\nChange, they say, is inevitable, and secularization is now an accomplished fact in America. That doesn’t mean that I like all of it, nor does it mean that I am not worried about its repercussions. The churches taught us that life is more than just a compilation of our personal wants and desires.\nWhat will there be to replace them?\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

However, the one thing that I do look forward to are the colors of fall foliage.\nRight across from my office window is a “burning bush” bush. As I write this, it is bright red. I don’t mean a little bit red or a faded red…, but a really fiery red! It almost looks as though someone with a spray gun came along and painted it red.\nMost colors in the fall are a bit more muted…but some maple trees can also make you think of the burning bush…a bright and pure red.\nOn another recent autumn day, it was gray and had been raining most of the day…but then the rain stopped, and the sun came out.\nIt was late in the afternoon and the sun’s rays were very angled, oblique, almost parallel to the landscape. When the sun is like this, it can light up the leaves of fall dramatically. My wife looked across the lake at the brilliance of it all with the trees in the distance lighted up against the black sky of a receding raincloud and said: “I have to take a picture of this.”\nShe is good with her cell phone and went out on the porch and snapped the picture. Soon it went out, “viral,” as they say, to our family over the family chat, internet, “cloud,” or whatever you want to call it… and in seconds the phone was soon buzzing back with “isn’t it beautiful,” “wish I were there,” etc. etc. accompanied by what the new generation calls “emojis,” things like smiling faces or “thumbs up” to show appreciation.\nOn such a day, you forget about the days when a blizzard can be whipping down this frozen lake, when you can’t even see across to the other side.\nThis description may not be apt, but fall colors remind me a lot of the paintings of impressionists. The artists of this genre were exceptionally gifted at displaying the effects of light on a landscape. I think that my wife’s photo that day, if painted by such an artist, would probably end up in an art gallery someplace.\nOkay, I may be getting a little teary-eyed about it all. I may even be getting out of my league. Often the things that I write about are related to the human landscape and the controversies which surround us…not about views from our front window.\nBut, once in a while, I think it is okay to just sit back, relax and take what mother nature gives you on the plus side.\nThere is a country song that speculates that if cowboys can’t get into heaven, then “take me to Texas, ’cause Texas is as close as I’ve been.” I would take issue with that.\nThink about a fall day with the sun shining down on the myriad colors of the trees lining Chautauqua Lake. It may not be heaven, but until you get there, this may be “as close as you’ve been.”\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

It is just one more indication that the push to go all-electric is slowing down.\nThere are, of course, reasons for this–and it has to do primarily with cost and reliability issues. Having everything become electric sounds good from an environmental perspective. But, now, people are coming to grips with how much that will cost–and the fact that it may not be as reliable as advertised.\nNational Grid is now asking for a big rate increase before the Public Service Commission–much of it related to increasing the capacity for the grid to handle new renewable energy sources as well as projected increases in electrical demand related to more electric vehicle use. The public is just now realizing how much all of this is going to cost.\nI think, though, that the cooling fervor for electric vehicles (EV’s) has also been driven by events – like the multiweek shutdown of the electric grid in Houston after a big hurricane. Electric vehicles don’t work very well when there is no electricity to charge the battery.\nOne of the other major weaknesses in electricity remains the problem of storage. Companies are now making bigger batteries that can store more electricity, but most batteries still run out of juice after a few hours. What happens when the grid is down for a few days?\nAll of this seems to be hypothetical until it happens to you…and then people begin to change their thinking.\nYou cannot dispute that there are advantages to EV’s especially in their simplicity. They have many fewer moving parts than a regular car… no pistons, valves, transmissions, and drive chains to break down. Their energy source, the battery and its dependence on the grid, is their weak point…the rest of what makes them run is quite efficient.\nYet, the bottom line, I guess, is that people tend to be practical. So, if you offer them something like a hybrid vehicle, which can run on electricity as well as gas, it is an option they may well take.\nIn any case, you can’t force energy decisions by just passing laws in Albany or Washington that require energy conversions by a certain date, deadlines which are then not met.\nNew discoveries will need to be made as to how electricity is generated and stored. My hope is that a new technology can be developed to control nuclear fusion, which would have great advantages over our current nuclear fission technology.\nIn the meantime, we will need a mix of energy fuels.

Over two days the Armies of the Union traversed Pennsylvania Avenue, from the Capitol to the White House, a seemingly unending sea of soldiers.\nIn the case of General Sherman’s Army, it took most of a day for all 65,000 to make that last march. In Sherman’s words:\n“For six hours and a half that strong tread of the Army of the West resounded along Pennsylvania Avenue; not a soul of that vast crowd of spectators left his place; and, when the rear of the column had passed by, thousands of spectators still lingered to express their confidence in the strength of a Government which could claim such an army.”\nThe great majority who made this march were not professional soldiers. They were civilians, some ex-slaves, recruited for war. The Army of the West had walked (marched) 2,000 miles–from Vicksburg and the Mississippi, across Tennessee, then down through Georgia, then up through South Carolina, North Carolina, Viriginia and finally to their Capitol. It had taken them two years.\nThis was their last march. They would then be heading home. The poignancy of it, the relief and exhilaration of it, the knowledge that a terrible Civil War was now over…it all came together in this last combined act of their Army, this march down Pennsylvania Avenue. It was a parade like no other.\nWhen you read Sherman’s remembrance of that day, it makes our present squabbles and national debate seem pale, almost meaningless. What sacrifices have we made that can even compare to it? Where would we be if slavery were still the law of the land? What if we had two countries, instead of one?\nAnd, we think that our nation today is divided and that things are contentious? Compare today to over 600,000 American war dead, families divided by civil war, the blood that was shed, the battle over slavery on this continent, a war to save the Union…our present problems, in that context, seem miniscule, just a small footnote in our history.\nReading this old history also reminds us that what we enjoy today and take for granted–this democracy we live in–did not come to us by chance. It came through the sacrifice and vision of predecessors. We rise from the shoulders of others.\nIt is humbling to remember this. We have so much today, that we tend to forget about these early days.\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman was a strong man, a proud man. He did not “suffer fools” easily. He could push back and was, sometimes, strong-headed to his detriment. Yet, he knew that without his Army, he would have been nothing. His soldiers called him “Uncle Billy.” I can see Sherman now, standing on the White House reviewing stand, after he had led that parade and then had joined the dignitaries, watching his troops go by, phalanx upon phalanx, and saluting them throughout the day. I wish I had been there.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a Vietnam veteran.\nTop of Form",

This one included a certificate hoping I would join him in a new “Lyin’ Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden Target List.”\nThis list would be “my badge of courage and honor” which I could frame, if I want to, and hang in a prominent place in my home. Of course, the name “Trump” is at the top of this list since he says that these two Democrats hate him, and “they hate you, too.”\n“The Radicals, Socialists, Communists, and Globalists around them–are out to get me because I am fighting for you.” Etc. etc.\nHe then urged me to send a contribution suggesting nine different amounts ranging from $35 to $3,300, and signs it: “God Bless America, Donald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States.”\nA couple of questions may arise in your mind. First, why would such a piece of hate/fear directed mail even be sent to me? The answer to that, I believe, is that I have been known to split my ticket when voting and, on occasion, have contributed to the campaigns of Republicans. Mr. Trump may have misconstrued that into my being a supporter of all Republicans, including him.\nPerhaps this mailing list I am now on came from the fact that in the past I had supported our former Congressman, Amo Houghton, a stalwart Republican, who was a good friend and an exceptional Representative for the Southern Tier in the Congress.\nIf that is the case, I am sure that Amo must be “turning in his grave.” In my last conversation with him before he died, he was outraged that Donald Trump with his divisive rhetoric had taken control of the Republican Party… a political institution which Houghton loved and had been affiliated with for his whole life.\nA second question may be: “When did the Democrats become “radicals, socialists and communists?” The answer is that they aren’t and never have been. These are just made-up words to stir up more disunity and fear.\nThe only other time in our history which compares to ours currently, in my view, was in the 1840’s and ‘50s. The Whig Party was taken over by fear mongers who were warning that immigrants, Catholics, Jews, foreigners, etc. were trying to take over the country. Whigs became known as the “Know Nothing Party,” and eventually disappeared from the face of our political landscape. A new party was born, the Republican Party, opposed to the extension of slavery into the new and expanding territories of the West. This Party, under Lincoln, fought a Civil War over the issue. After that, it developed its traditional conservative, pro-business policies as the nation expanded.\nCan that Republican Party again find its roots? Can it again become a party advocating for smaller government, engagement in bi-partisan foreign policy (not isolationism,) and in advancing pro-business policies. Can it move away from demanding allegiance to only one person, and from the politics of vitriol, personal attacks and target lists?\nIn large measure, that is what this current election is all about.\nAnd, if you are wondering whether or not I sent in any money to be on this special target list…the answer to that is “not one thin dime.”\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\nTop of Form\nBottom of Form",

There was a lot to see.\nA bridge is a bit like an iceberg in that there is much more of it below the road surface than above it. That means that much of the construction work is also more visible underneath, from down below.\nWhat hits you immediately from the water level is how massive the under-decking is that was built to protect workers as well as keep construction debris out of the lake. (It had to be expensive to build.) It hangs below the bridge supported by steel rods from above. It also has lowered the distance from the waterline to the highest arch of the bridge from about 42 feet to some 34 feet.\nSince this structure is already built, it would be nice if somehow it could be converted into a bikeway/walkway. But, it appears, from its design, that this is probably not possible.\nThe day we were there, jack-up barges were nestled up to a couple of the supporting columns of the bridge and moveable basket cranes (the kind that you see on roof jobs or when painting tall houses) were placed on top of them. Men were in the baskets with airguns cutting out bad concrete soiled by years of wear from salt used to treat the road in the winter.\nNew forms had been built in places to replace this old, deteriorated concrete, and one must guess that recent night closures may have been related to the pouring of new concrete in these areas as well as in patching pavement on the open lanes above.\nWhat impresses you most from beneath, at the water level, is the realization of just how much human work goes into a bridge repair job of this magnitude. Workers have to do this dirty, physical, hard, manual work. There is no other way that it can be done. My hat goes off to those now working on the bridge.\nWhen you look up toward the bridge deck from the water level, you also see what, in the Navy, we called “scuppers”–downspouts that discharge rain water, snow melt and the salt that comes with it to the lake below.\nThen it hit me that instead of repairing these downspouts–perhaps a bikeway/walkway on each side of the bridge could be designed to divert these liquids in the winter. These structures would carry pedestrians and bikes in the summer, but, when snow starts falling and the slush accumulates, they would catch the plowed snow with the salt and, when it melts, divert it to the shores of the lake to be contained there for proper disposal.\nCould this improve things environmentally as well as provide public pedestrian access while, at the same time, reduce corrosion to the bridge? (DOT…we may have a win-win possibility here!) At least, it may be something to consider if the Village of Bemus Point is successful in receiving the grant for which it has applied to assess the feasibility of such a project.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "The Contest Is Now Joined\nLocal Commentaries\nSep 14, 2024\nRolland Kidder\nI mentioned several weeks ago that Joe Biden, in the June debate, had shown that he was incapable of running again a national campaign for the Presidency. Mr. Biden eventually came to the same conclusion and removed himself from the race.\nThis week there was another debate, and it was clear, no matter whom you favored, that we now again have a viable campaign underway for this highest office in our land. The contest is now joined.\nTo be honest, it would be a stretch to actually call what we saw a “debate.” It was more a verbal boxing match than an in-depth analysis of issues facing the country. The country knew what to expect from former President Trump. What we didn’t know is how Vice President Harris would hold up under the pressure and scrutiny of it.\nI think it is safe to say that, in that respect, she did just fine. She went “toe-to-toe” with the former President. She held her own and let him be himself.\nEver since the first televised Presidential debate between Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy, it has become evident that these so-called “debates” are really more performance contests than anything else. Though issues were debated more thoughtfully in that first debate, the “winner,” so called, was deemed to be Mr. Kennedy because he looked sharper and more articulate in presenting his views. Mr. Nixon seemed to be tired and not as much at ease as Mr. Kennedy.\nIn other words, one candidate performed better than the other.\nAnother performance that I remember was that between President Reagan and former Vice President Mondale. The press and the pundits had been hyping the issue of President Reagan’s age, as compared to the younger Mr. Mondale. President Reagan put that down with one sentence, promising early in the debate that he “would not make Mr. Mondale’s age an issue in this election.” Everyone laughed and after that, Ronald Reagan cruised to re-election.\nNonetheless, what all of this points to is what I think is really an evident weakness in our political system. Every four years, we choose our Presidents from a very narrow field–usually, it comes down to only two people, as to who will lead our executive branch of government.\nOne advantage I see in other democracies–like most countries in Europe–is that the political leader of the country emerges after many years of serving in a parliament where they can be vetted and evaluated by their peers. In our country, you can come out of nowhere with a slogan and lot of money, with no political experience, and become President of the United States.\nYet, our system is what it is. The Constitution set it up this way, and so every four years we again go through these election campaigns. In order to “protect” the process and secure the support of the smaller states, the Constitutional Convention also set up the mechanism of the Electoral College. Though this seems archaic today and can allow a candidate with fewer popular votes win the Presidency– unless changed by constitutional amendment (which is not easy,) the Electoral College will likely be with us for many years to come.\nSo–the campaign has now begun with all the hoopla and political advertising that goes with it. Sit back and “enjoy” –or, at least, bear with it. It will be over in less than two months!\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

The cost of housing always seems to be near the top of the list, but that is quickly followed by mental illness and drug addiction as contributing factors. Spent injection needles and defecation in public places seem to be a footprint of the homeless gathering places locally.\nWhat also seems to be a common denominator is that, with at least some who are homeless–there is also a desire to be together, that those so situated prefer their own community to being in a more structured environment.\nThe city has asked for help from others — from New York state, the county, and from non-profit organizations. Unfortunately, the state largely closed most of its residential facilities for the mentally ill years ago, and few established institutions were created to deal with crises like this.\nIt is my understanding that at least some of the homeless in Jamestown are here because our local hospital is one of the few places where they can be brought for treatment. They are often brought to the hospital by law enforcement or emergency services personnel, including those from adjoining counties. After they are released, many choose to stay here.\nWhen I was a kid, homelessness was associated primarily with men who had problems related to drinking and alcohol addiction. The Union Rescue Mission was the primary facility in those days in dealing with the issue.\nAn underlying problem and, perhaps, it has always been, is that many of these individuals have few if any strong family connections. By congregating together they are, in a way, creating a family of their own.\nOf course, society must act and solutions must be found. We cannot let people die on the streets, nor should we be turning our streets, parks and public spaces into compounds for the homeless.\nIn the end, processes must be in place so that judges, courts and public officials are empowered to effectively deal with the issue … and facilities are available to provide for proper long-term housing and treatment.\nNone of this is easy, but the task must be undertaken.\nRolland Kidder is a\nStow resident.",

      "text": "Assessing Risk Then Acting On It\nLocal Commentaries\nAug 24, 2024\nRolland Kidder\nI have been back reading U.S. Grant’s Memoirs of the Civil War. It is probably the third or fourth time, and each time I find new “nuggets” of what made this man “tick.”\nPresident Lincoln worked with a lot of Generals during the war. Most of them could recognize risk, but many of them were unwilling to act on it. General McClellan was probably the most well-known of this type.\nAs Lincoln looked over the entire panoply of Generals in the Army, it was the younger, less conspicuous, less voluble man in the West who kept “popping up” and who ultimately captured Lincoln’s attention–Ulysses S. Grant.\nGrant’s first great battle was at Shiloh in 1862. His Army ran straight into a Confederate Army along the Tennessee/Mississippi border. Grant put his whole Army at risk, and after a two-day slugfest with thousands of casualties and, at times, the outcome uncertain–the Confederate Army withdrew from the field.\nGrant’s next great victory came in 1863 at Vicksburg, a place he surrounded by taking the risk of moving his troops down the west side of the Mississippi River, then crossing them below Vicksburg and finally attacking the city from its South and East. It was unexpected and risky, but Vicksburg finally surrendered.\nYet, it was his action, later that same year at Chattanooga that finally propelled Grant to becoming the General of all of the Union’s Armies. In October 1863, the Union forces at Chattanooga were virtually surrounded and were starving. The Secretary of War and the President were worried that they could collapse and sent in Grant.\nGrant got to Chattanooga late in the month, traversing by horseback a mountainous trail covered with thousands of corpses of dead horses and mules who had already perished from lack of fodder. It wasn’t a promising picture, and the Army itself needed food.\nWithin a week, Grant had decided on a different route to bring in food and supplies by pushing through Confederate Territory and coming up from the southwest over a shorter distance. By using the Tennessee River, then cutting cross-country to the same River and building a bridge at Brown’s Ferry near Chattanooga– supplies for the Army started coming in. The troops called it the “Cracker Line,” as it brought them crackers (and food) that they hadn’t seen for weeks.\nThe decision was risky, but Grant acted. A starving Army can’t fight.\nThe terrain around Chattanooga is rough and mountainous…you may have driven through it on I-75 if you have gone that way to Atlanta. Confederate forces held most of the high ground. But, by mid-November, Grant had moved thousands of new troops over the same “Cracker Line,” primarily at night to avoid their discovery. On November 24th, over a 10-mile-long line, 60,000 Union troops attacked simultaneously taking Missionary Ridge, the valleys east and south of Chattanooga, and ultimately Lookout Mountain itself.\nDuring this same time, Grant was under tremendous pressure from Washington to rush to the aid of General Burnside in Knoxville to the north. Yet, he withstood that pressure until Chattanooga was secure, then sent General Sherman’s troops north to relieve Knoxville. After that, most of Tennessee was under the control of the Union.\nIt was clear, after Chattanooga, that Grant was the man who would assess risk and then act on it. Within 4 months of the victory in Chattanooga, Lincoln would bring him to Washington and Virginia to become General of all Union Armies. Thousands would still die in our Civil War, but its outcome was now assured.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

I am not sure there is a way to describe what it means, other than it conveys the idea that “things have changed” or “the situation is now reversed.”\nHowever it is used, it seems to describe what has now happened in our national politics. The Republicans, who seemed to be unbeatable in the Presidential race after the disastrous showing of President Biden in the June debate–now seem to be scrambling to regain their traction after Biden’s announcement that he was dropping out of the race.\n“The shoe is on the other foot.” Kamala Harris is now the Democratic nominee for President.\nThis does not mean that she will carry Chautauqua County. Our default politics around here are Republican. However, in “toss-up” areas of the country, she has brought new energy to the race and the Democrats now seem to have a fighting chance.\nOne change that I have noticed around here is that some Republicans have expressed worry and are now urging Donald Trump to talk about policy–the inference being that he tends to talk more about himself than about the issues facing the country.\nMy own view is that the election is still Mr. Trump’s to lose. He had a big “head of steam” going into this election, and the electorate is still concerned about inflation and the economy. That, automatically, puts those governing in potential jeopardy at the polls.\nYet, it is not beyond the realm of possibility, that Harris could pull this off and become the first woman ever elected to be President of the United States. That possibility scares the pants off some but is a point of great anticipation and rejoicing for others.\nTo be honest, I was hoping that Harris would name Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky as her running mate. Yet, her decision to choose Governor Tim Walz still brings geographic and political balance to the ticket. Walz, aside from being a Governor, also has military experience, was a Congressman for 10 years, and coached high school football–all of which may have “tipped the scales” in his favor.\nHowever the election turns out, it was good for the country that Joe Biden decided not to run for re-election. As I wrote in this column after the disastrous debate–because of obvious age-related issues, it was clear that he was no longer able to carry on an effective national campaign for the Presidency. Except for unanimously electing George Washington, we have always had a vigorous and articulated debate between at least two viable contenders for this highest office in our land.\nRecently, friends from Germany were visiting, and it was revealing to get their European “take” on our Presidential elections. Germany, like virtually all countries in Europe, has a parliamentary form of government where the Prime Minister becomes leader only after many years of political experience as a legislator. In contrast, our campaigns for the Presidency seem, to them, more a personality contest than a discussion on matters of government.\nHowever you view it, we are now right in the middle of another Presidential election. The people, through our electoral college system, will, in another three months, decide who will lead our nation over the next four years. That has been the American way for over 200 years.\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "The Bridge and Lake—Current Happenings\nAs you cross the Chautauqua Lake Bridge these days, you see a lot of open steel with the concrete removed sitting on the southwest side. Yet, concrete removal, in general, seems to have slowed. The focus now seems to be on making repairs below, chipping away bad concrete spots and replacing that with new cement. \nThe bigger challenge of removing concrete on the arched (or belly) section of the bridge, at least, for now, has not begun. It is now August, so thought must be going into how winter will affect construction and traffic on the bridge. The current open lanes seem to be quite narrow. Will the snow-plow trucks be able to get through? We must assume that the DOT has a winter plan for snow removal in mind. \nAs to the idea of including a bikeway/walkway as a part of the project, the Village of Bemus Point, supported by other local governments, the County Executive, and several non-profit groups--has submitted a grant application to study this feasibility with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA.) We now must await a decision on that request from Washington. \nAs to other issues around the lake, kudos to the County Legislature for moving ahead on a feasibility study to complete sewers around the lake. If that can be done, then the whole lake, including Dewittville to just north of the Midway Park area, will have public sewers. \nResearch on aquatic issues facing the lake continues to advance with more sensing devices being installed to monitor water quality. \nPerhaps the biggest announcement in terms of water quality came recently from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In co-operation with Chautauqua County Government, the Army Corps is undertaking a massive study on the impact of harmful algae in the lake, and what might be possible actions to address that problem. \nWhat has engaged lake homeowners the most this summer has been the threat, or purported threat, posed by the New York State DEC in making new wetland maps. Signs have popped up all over saying “Keep the Lake, a Lake!” Politically, that seems to be an easy win. Who, after all, wants to ask the DEC permission to do anything on their property?\nIt is unclear at this point what actually would change with new DEC wetland mapping. The DEC says “not much,” but, nevertheless, legislation has been introduced in Albany to be sure nothing much does change. It would seem that the DEC has a lot of things it needs to pay attention to other than getting diverted off into some new controversy like expanding its wetland jurisdiction across the state.\nIn the midst of all of this, summer activity continues in high gear on the lake, and the Season at Chautauqua Institution has been a busy one. \nVarious fairs, festivals, and community celebrations continue as they always have—and \nthe fishermen continue to co-exist with the pleasure boat people. It also seems that pontoon boats are becoming, more-and-more, the preferred watercraft on the lake. \n-\nWe live in a pretty special place here, and there is nothing better than a good summer on Chautauqua Lake!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Awaiting the Decision of the Electorate\nIt is the day before the election as I am writing this, and I have just finished reading a newspaper article full of advice from a psychiatrist about how to deal with election angst—the anxiety of waiting for election results.\nIf the average person feels this way, just think of what it must be for the candidates. They are the ones who have put their name on the line and have submitted themselves to the will of the electorate.\nI still vividly remember my own personal experience, one day, of going through this. It was 1970. I had just returned from Vietnam, had won a primary election while overseas, but now—after a long, hard-fought general election campaign—was awaiting the decision of the voters. It was a long day, and, at the end of it, the voters said: “ ‘No,’ you will not be going to Albany.”\nStan Lundine was Mayor of Jamestown then, and, as the final returns came in at Democratic election headquarters, he came over to me and said: “Sorry, about the result. You ran a good campaign. Come with me. We are going to pay a visit.”\n“Where?” I asked. “We are going down to the Liberty AC Club where the Republicans are having a victory party so that you can congratulate Jack Beckman on his re-election to the Assembly.”\nAnd, so we did. It wasn’t much fun, and we didn’t stick around long to celebrate with them. But, it was the right thing to do. Elections have an end. It is not your job you are running for. It belongs to the people, to the electorate. They make that decision. It is not yours to make.\nEventually, four years later, I won that seat and was elected to the Assembly. But, I will never forget the lesson I learned that night in 1970. The people who would decide my fate did so at the ballot box. That is the American way.\nEver since then, I have always been at “loose ends” on election days. Though I am no longer a candidate, I can feel the angst and, in a sense, the loneliness of those running for office. As a candidate, you believe that you are the best person for the job, or you wouldn’t be running. Yet, the decision of whether or not you get the job will be a decision made by others.\nWhether you are running for something like the Presidency of the United States or a seat on the Town Board—election day is always a long day. You have done everything that you can. There is no time left. The people are in the voting booth, and they will decide your fate.\nThere is a sense of vulnerability when you are a candidate. There is great joy if you win, and it is a real downer if you lose. \nThe silver lining in the cloud is that you have been part of a process underway in this country since its founding that has been fundamental to our democracy—free and fair elections. \nDemocracies require candidates for office as well as voters. When the elections are over, win or lose, we congratulate the victor—that too is the American way.\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Canaries In A Coal Mine—The Trigger That Ended World War II\nWars are easy to start but notoriously difficult to end. That was the case in World War II. Though the Emperor of Japan had announced on August 15, 1945 that Japan was surrendering, there were well-founded doubts about whether the country could or would surrender.\nOne must remember than throughout all of the horrific battlegrounds of the Pacific, the Japanese had been ordered to die to the last man for the Emperor...and most had. The American casualties on places like Okinawa and Iwo Jima were horrific, but he vast majority of Japanese there had been killed...they would not surrender.\nNow, with one message could all of this be turned around? Would the surrender hold? Not only were Americans worried, but one must assume that the Emperor himself was concerned. \nThe Japanese cabinet had been split on ending the war. Three Naval Officers in the Japanese cabinet had sided with the Emperor on ____ August, to end the war. The three Army representatives in the cabinet had voted to continue the war. The Emperor broke the deadlock...the war was to end. \nOn _____August, there had been an attempted coup at the Imperial Palace to stop the public announcement of the Emperor’s decision. Now that surrender had been announced, would the surrender hold? Would the Japanese military and Japanese people honor it?\nIn reading histories and books written about this time, I have always been struck by the dearth of information dealing with the internal turmoil of the last two weeks of World War II—that time between the Emperor’s announcement on August 15, 1945 and the formal surrender of the Japanese on September 2, 1945.\nHistories seem to jump from the Japanese announcement of surrender to General MacArthur’s big show on the deck of the Battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay...as if it were a foregone conclusion. \nYet, apprehension on both sides and logic itself would require that somehow there had to be a test as to the viability of the upcoming surrender and occupation of Japan. The United States was not going to send its senior five star general, Douglas MacArthur, into defeated Japan unless there was some assurance that the surrender was real. \nMacArthur wrote in his official history of the occupation of Japan that “the first American troops arrived in Japan on _______. They may have been the first American Army troops that entered the country, but others had preceded them—Americans, likely mostly Navy men were landed in three locations to “test the waters”, so-to-speak. From an analysis of radio messaging, it seems that this happened either on the evening of August 21, 1945 or early in the morning on the 22nd of August,1945.\nThose who landed were essentiallly “canaries in a coal mine,” whose life or death would determine if Japan was ready to surrender. They apparently all survived, though their story has never been told. Their bravery and role in starting the actual surrender of Japan were quietly and cryptically announced by Admiral William “Bull” Halsey, Commander of the Third Fleet who was ,by then, actively coordinating then naval forces around Japan with General MacArthur—who, by that time, who was running the upcoming occupation of Japan end from his headquarters in Manila.\nIn a Top Secret message dated 21 August 1945 at 2327- Z (Greenwich Mean Time)...or 0827 in the morning on August 22nd Japan time, Halsey wrote this activating the formal Operations Order directing the surrender and occupation of Japan:\n“Japan has surrendered. Army forces have seized ATSUGI airfield, and CINCAFPAC \nAdvance Headquarters are established there. CTF 31 forces hold YOKOSUKA",

How could this be?\nDonald Trump may want a ballroom added to the White House, but the White House is not Mar-a-Lago. It is the people’s House, a national treasure, and symbolizes the simplicity and beauty of the American democracy.\nThis is not just a rap on Donald Trump. No President should be able to make such changes to the White House without input from those who protect our national treasures that occupy the National Mall.\nI was on the Site and Design Committee for the National World War II Memorial. We went through muliple public hearings before such vetting agencies as the National Capitol Planning Commission and Commission of Fine Arts of the United States. Sometimes, it was not an easy process, but through it, the Memorial became better and more fitting for its surroundings. \nSome might call this “big government.” But, what we have now in Washington seems to be “bigger government.” You can demolish the East Wing of the White House, buy $ 9 billion of stock in the Intel Corporation, or buy $30 billion dollars of Argentine pesos to prop up a South American country...and there is nary a whisper. \nCongress is on vacation, the Supreme Court is mute and the country stands by impotently and watches the White House morph into Mar-a-Lago. This is wrong. If a Democrat were doing this, the Republicans would be up in arms. The last time the White House was treated with such wholesale destruction was during the War of 1812...and that was done by the British.",

      "text": "When The Chickens Come Home to Roost\nThis is an old saying which essentially means that things which are foreseeable and need to be fixed but are not...will, sooner or later, eventually need to be dealt with.\nIn Chautauqua County, right now, two municipalities seem to be in the forefront as to this situation—Dunkirk and Fredonia. \nI know only what I read in the newspaper, but, it appears, that tax rates in both municipalities are going up 40%-50% in order to balance their budgets. \nHow did this come to pass? Things don’t happen overnight in government. There had to be issues that were deferred, ignored or somehow “swept under the rug.”\nThe south county is not totally out-of-the woods. The City of Jamestown, by dipping into their cash reserves, brought the tax levy down to a 3.6% increase. Yet, the City’s primary expense challenge remains the same—the salaries and fringe benefit costs of its Police and Fire Departments consume about half of the city budget. Without federal ARPA monies, next year will likely result in another budget challenge for Jamestown.\nIn the City of Dunkirk, there has always been a looming crisis caused by the closing of the NRG Electric Generating Station. At one time, this utility was paying a great portion of the total tax levy in Dunkirk. A gradual reduction over several years in those taxes was a part of the shutdown of the plant. Everyone knew that these tax subsidies would come to an end...there was time to prepare.\nIn the case of Fredonia, what I have heard most about are the costs they are facing with an old water system and a sewer plant that needs significant upgrades. Again, these are issues that didn’t just start happening overnight. But, apparently, addressing the issues was put off.\nMy experience in being involved in and observing government over the years is that it is much easier to add programs, people and services than it is to reduce them. Yet, at some point, when “push comes to shove,” government spending must be aligned with the ability of those who are paying the bill.\nI was in the state legislature in the mid-1970’s when the City of New York was on the verge of bankruptcy. The City had to cut back on spending, and a new Mayor was elected, Ed Koch, who went about doing that. I always respected Koch for being a strong Mayor and being willing to say “No” to many of the entrenched interests living off the City of New York. Ultimately, New York City had to learn to live within its means.\nAs to the future here, being a “Monday morning quarterback,” contributes little, if anything, to the conversation. Dwelling on the past is not a solution. \nWhat is needed is for the public to encourage those who are now trying to deal with the fiscal problems in our communities...even if this means cutting back or combining some services.\nThe “chickens have come home to roost,” and now is the time for elected officials to make the tough decisions necessary to correct things... and for the public to support such actions. \nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "War Department Not a Good Idea\nOur President announced recently that we should rename the Defense Department, the “War Department” because we have not been winning enough wars. That is a bad idea.\nMaybe it was an idea that came from some of the “issue for the day” people that he has surrounded himself with, i.e. it didn’t originate from him. But, still, war is not something that we should be embracing, promoting or touting in any manner. \nCongress and the courts should just let the Defense Department remain the “Defense” Department. Let the President sign all of the Executive Orders that he wants to...but let’s not go back to the “War” Department.\nI have often thought, though it may be just happenstance, that Robert H. Jackson may have influenced the renaming of the old War Department as the new “Defense Department” back in 1947. Remember, he had just gone through the major trial of Nazi defendants at Nuremberg. \nOne of Jackson’s observations coming out of that experience is engraved on the flagpole base at the Robert Jackson Center here in town. It says: “If we can root out of men’s thinking that all wars are legal... at last we will have mobilized the forces of law on the side of peace.”\nThe last thing we need to do to promote peace in the world is to go back to the idea that war is inevitable and legitimate. Yes, we do have a right to defend ourselves as a nation...but that gives us no right to frame “war” as an objective by giving it the priority of departmental status in our government. \nAdmittedly, the name change to Defense Department came out of a long-needed reorganization of our military services... an evaluation sparked in many ways by our experience in the Second World War. There had been serious divisions during that conflict between the Army and the Navy, and there was also a perceived need to create the Air Force as a separate service. Better coordination was needed. That reorganization also gave impetus to creating a department of “defense” and not “war.”\nIn the United States, a strong defense has always been framed as a way to avoid war, not to promote it.\nI know something about war, having actually been in one and in combat. It is not something anyone should want.\nSo, Mr. President, I am assuming that the idea of creating a War Department was not a serious proposal, but just something to get people like me riled up. I know that you had a falling out with both General “Mad Dog” Mattis and General Kelly in your first administration, both of whom had distinguished careers in the Marine Corps. But on something as consequential as renaming the Pentagon as the home of “war” instead of “defense,”—perhaps you should pull them back into your orbit one more time and ask them what they might think of such an idea.\nRolland Kidder\nVietnam Veteran",

Though neither now live in Queens, this is the place where they “cut their eye teeth” when it came to business and politics.\nHaving spent a few years in Albany (now many years ago,) I had a “bird’s eye view” of politicians from across the state. Queens was known then as a scrappy place where people grew up battling, in one form or another, for everything from political turf to business advantage.\nLife there seemed to be right out of Darwin, where competition was rampant and only the strong survived. And... survive they have!\nDonald Trump won the Presidency and then lost it, and then regained it again, despite some sexual improprieties that in court judgments have cost him a lot of money. Andrew Cuomo won the Governorship of New York only to lose it in a sexual harassment scandal (which he has never admitted to,) and now seems poised to re-enter politics as Mayor of the City of New York as front-runner in the primary election being held there next week. \nI guess that you could describe the political style of these two men as “in your face politics.” Always be on the offensive, keep changing the narrative, keep your name in the headlines, never admit guilt or wrongdoing, and you will ultimately be rewarded with success.\nWhat they also seem to have in common is a “top down” approach to governing. They both act as though they are smarter than everyone else in the room, and they will tell you how things are going to go down. They are also known for making promises that are hollow and unfulfilled.\nWhen running for Governor, Andrew Cuomo promised to appoint a special Task Force on Natural Gas Drilling in the Southern Tier and abide by their recommendation. Once elected, he called his then brother-in-law, Bobby Kennedy Jr., about the issue. Kennedy was anti-fracking and anti-natural gas—so Cuomo ignored his promise and his commission’s recommendation and shut down natural gas drilling in the state. That moratorium is still in effect though millions in the state depend upon natural gas to heat their homes.\nSimilarly, Donald Trump, promised that he could solve the Ukraine/Russian War in 24 hours if elected President. He made a similar promise that he would solve Israel’s war with Gaza. Both promises are still unfulfilled.\nPromises are made not to be kept, but to win elections. That all comes from the hard-scrabble lessons learned in Queens.\nIt is interesting how politics seems to have been “turned on its head” now as one former Governor from Queens is poised to be elected Mayor of the City of New York, primarily because it is expected that he will be the strongest and toughest in challenging another man from Queens who sits again in the Oval Office.\nYet, it could be that these two guys will get along. Their style of governing is the same, and they have a common bond with Bobby Kennedy Jr. who is now in the cabinet.\nHowever, it works out between Cuomo and Trump...the Borough of Queens should be a winner. \nRolland Kidder\nUpstate New Yorker",

That comes next year when there will be elections for Congress.\nThat doesn’t mean that the elections this year are unimportant. Who we elect for County Executive, the County Legislature and other local offices is still important. Local elections give us the opportunity to choose elected officials who are the closest to us, and who operate most of the government that we deal with on a daily basis. \nSome don’t like them, but I am a big believer in political campaign signs. They remind us of our obligation to participate in government.\nThis year, I have seen signs for the Republican candidate for County Executive but none, so far, for the Democrat who is running. If the election were held today, I doubt that many people would even be aware that a race is going on for this position. That is sad, as County Executive is an office that we should be interested in. \nThere is also an election this year for County Clerk, and I have seen signs for both the Republican and Democratic candidates. This is a lesser-known office, but the County Clerk has the important obligation of filing deeds and other instruments at the courthouse. In addition, the Clerk runs the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and administers its various offices in the county. The general public probably has more contact with the DMV than with any other government office.\nI have also seen political signs for County Legislative races, though there are several districts in which there is not a political contest. \nWhen there is no contest for a political office, it makes for a “real quiet” election. That may be good for the only candidate running, but it does not leave a choice for the voter...which is what elections are all about.\nThat brings up the subject of the health of our election system as a whole. Sadly, I believe, it is harder than ever to get people to run for office. Elected office can be a “thankless” job. It takes time to go to meetings, pass resolutions, laws, budgets and do all of the other things required for the functioning of government. \nYet, at its core, there is nothing more important in our corporate life as citizens than elections. It is essential that we have people running for public office. That should be part of our DNA as Americans.\nThe bottom line, I guess, is that I just don’t like “quiet” elections. I want to hear the candidates, listen to the issues being debated, be invigorated with all of the “hoopla” surrounding the whole process, and then participate as a voter in actually choosing who our political leaders will be. \nWe need to stay involved in our government, lest we lose it. There is no substitute for elections. I commend those who are running...I just wish that there were more citizens willing to become candidates for public office.\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

If I were in his inner circle, I would advise him that this is an honor for which you are chosen—not one you lobby or campaign for.\nBut, that aside, if he can pull off a solution to the current Israeli/Gazan War, perhaps he should be so honored. \nAs the columnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote: “If Donald Trump is able to secure a cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, return of Israeli hostages, and it holds and paves the way for negotiations on the only solution of two states for two people...Trump will not only deserve the Nobel Peace Prize, he’ll deserve the Nobel Prize in Physics and Chemistry as well. Because that would be quite an achievement.”\nI have not been a fan of Donald Trump’s top-down approach to governing nor of many of his policies—but, I too am hoping that he can find a way out of this terrible war in which Hamas killed some 2,000 Israelis, and where Israel has killed some 60,000 Palestinians in response. \nPresident Trump is in a unique position to end this conflict. First, and foremost, in being as close as he is to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s leader, Trump essentially coopted him, pushing Netanyahu into accepting a ceasefire and bringing the war to an end.\nTrump also has deep roots and connections to the Arab countries of the Middle East, not just as President but through his family and business connections with countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These nations met in Egypt with the United States and hammered out a deal to end the Israeli-Gazan War. Great Britain and France were also supporting the effort. It was not just the United States that was involved.\nAny resolution from the carnage of Gaza to Israel’s exhaustion and diminishment resulting from this war, will require support from Arab nations in the region. Meetings are continuing in Egypt with several countries now involved including representatives from the United Nations.\nSo, Mr. President, I give you credit for getting the parties to the table, and, as an American, I am hoping that your efforts can lead to a permanent peace in the area.\nMy only advice would be that you keep after the effort. It will take time. This is no “slam-dunk,” quick-and-its-over situation. The divisions and hatreds in this part of the world run deep, so whatever solution is arrived at must have staying power and will require a long-term commitment. Wars are easy to start, but difficult to end.\nFriedman addressed this same issue with a question: “Will the Trump administration have the attention, the energy and the focus that’ll be required every day to keep such a complicated solution on track?” “I hope so,” he concludes.\nI hope so too. If President Trump can stop this war, keep it stopped, start a new and responsible governance for Palestine, and keep Israel within its borders...maybe he will be recognized for his work by the Nobel Committees in Norway and Sweden. \nIt may seem unlikely that a President who has created a Department of War instead of Defense would receive a Peace Prize, but stranger things have been known to have happened down through the course of human history.\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

No sitting in a warm truck to do the job, not in an office watching the weather—but, right out there in the heart of the cold and wind removing a downed tree and re-stringing downed power lines. I shiver and get cold just thinking about it.\nYes, we know that they are well paid. But, so what—would you want to be out there where they are?\nI am a bit of a weather “nut” which I think goes way back to my days on the farm when we needed good weather to dry hay in the fields. That interest was accentuated when I got my pilot’s license—flying into bad weather is not usually recommended.\nThis past week-end was a good example of how weather affects our lives—about 200 million Americans were in the path of a big storm that left a swath of snow and ice from Texas to New England, and reports were that about 800,000 homes lost power during the storm.\nHere, we received about a foot of snow on top of the 109 inches we have already received this winter.\nAs of this writing, most power outages from the storm have been restored...but, let’s not forget those who got the power back on.

      "text": "The Importance of Esprit De Corps\nThe importance of “esprit de corps” hit me recently as I was watching the workers on the sewer construction job now being built north of Stow on the west side of the lake. These French words refer to team spirit, to people respecting each other and working together for a common purpose.\nThe construction workers on this job work as a team without a lot of shouting or being “bossed” around. They just do their jobs and expect those around them to do the same. It is obvious that they respect each other and like their jobs.\nOne may be on a backhoe, another laying out the route of pipe for the next day, another restoring areas disturbed as the new sewer system is installed—but their effort is quite seamless. It is inspiring to watch.\nIn looking back at my own life experience, it made me recall my first duty assignment as a new Ensign in the U.S. Navy back in 1967. I was assigned to be the Operations Officer on a small ship homebased in Sasebo, Japan.\nIt truly was a small ship by Navy standards...60 men with 6 officers were its contingent. In reflection, though, what really made its smallness significant is that we usually operated alone, not in the company of other ships. \nOur mission required us to work with other allied Navies in that part of the world, so we would travel to places like South Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. to do our work...and we would travel alone. \nWe didn’t think much about it then, but the fact that we could travel such long distances without significant help close by was a testament to the commitment of members of the crew to each other and to our dependence upon each other. People knew their jobs, respected each other, and trusted in one another.\nHere I was...a greenhorn, boot Ensign right out of Officer Candidate School and while underway was assigned as an Officer of the Deck on the bridge responsible for the safety and movements of the ship for four hours at a time, often in the middle of the night. But, it wasn’t just me up there on the bridge, there was a duty section consisting of one third of the crew up and working at the same time all over the ship doing their jobs. We were a team. There was an “esprit de corps” in what we were doing.\nI remember one time on that ship when we were caught in what were close to typhoon-force winds while enroute from Taiwan back to our homebase in Japan. The seas were so high that they had the power to roll the ship over. We had to keep the bow of the ship into the oncoming waves to avoid this.\nThe bridge was about 25 ft. above the waterline, and the waves were about 30 ft. in height. Sometimes, for a second or two, the sea would sweep over the bow, and then we would lurch up with the bow nearly out of the water as the ship headed over the crest and then pitched down into the following trough as the next wave approached. It went on like this for about two days.\nIt wasn’t much fun, but we were not alarmed. Everyone was doing their job as a team to ensure that the ship got through.\nIt only takes about one such time in your life going through something like this to make you realize that your life is dependent upon the lives and work of others. “Esprit De Corps” is real. It is necessary. It is what makes the world work, and we need more of it.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

Yet, what makes it so immense is that it is like seeing ten or twelve such buildings all tied together. The size of it dominates the horizon.\nI can remember only two other public work projects in Western New York than can even compare with it—one being the completion of the New York State Thruway in 1960 and the other, at about the same time, the building and completion of the Niagara Power Project in Niagara Falls.\nYet those projects did not have the visual impact of the new Bills stadium. The Thruway was a linear roadway, and you didn’t sense its presence much until you drove on it. \nThe Niagara Power Project was built mostly underground carrying water from above the first rapids to below the last rapids of the Niagara River through two large 60 ft. diameter buried conduits thus doubling the height (or head) of falling water of prior power plants which had been built right at the base of the falls. Though having great impact, being built largely below ground, the Power Project is next to invisible as you travel through our area.\nNot so with the new Bills stadium. It stands out like the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. It is going to be a new “marker” for Western New York.\nI remember back to the days when Ralph Wilson paid a pittance for this football team, and they were playing their games at the old “Rock Pile” Stadium in Buffalo. I went to some of those games. Then came the big decision to move the Bills to the suburbs at One Bills Drive, their current stadium. Here the Bills became the beloved and integral part of Western New York that we now know.\nYet, I may still live long enough to see them playing in another brand new stadium in Orchard Park, this one costing $1.5 billion. Who would have “thunk” it?\nI have to give credit to Terry Pegula, owner of the Bills and formerly from Olean, who stepped up to the plate to make it happen. I, for one, also commend the Governor and the State of New York for pitching in. Western New York, on its own, did not have the means or where-with-all to get it done. It took a commitment from the State of New York. It also didn’t hurt that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, born in Jamestown, also wanted the new stadium.\nThe Bills are still the only team in the NFL homeported in New York. The Jets and the Giants play their games in New Jersey.\nWhen it comes to economic development and growing Western New York, I believe that the new Bills Stadium will be of significant help. When people come to this area looking for a job or a new home, after seeing Niagara Falls, they are going to say: “Now, take me to that new Bills Stadium!”\nEven if you don’t like football, you must admit that having an NFL team in a small-market town like Buffalo is a significant “feather in our cap.” Will we ever make it to the Super Bowl? Who knows? But, on we go...Go Bills!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "The Ice Fishermen Are Back!\nThe other day, late in the afternoon, the dogs exploded with barking. Usually, that happens when an unfamiliar delivery truck comes down the driveway. This time, it was the almost predictable annual arrival of a good friend who had come to park his pickup truck and then walk out to test the thickness of the ice.\nSure enough, he walked a couple of hundred yards offshore, put a drill bit to work through the ice, and a good solid 3 or 4 inches of ice core was revealed. It was time to fish!\nHe was back about an hour later, just at dusk, with a old ice-fishing pal... and soon their tent was up, a good fishing hole had been bored through the ice, and the fishing began.\nI didn’t see him come off the ice that night, but expect that he probably had a couple of good-sized walleye with him when he headed for home.\nI know that he also fishes in the summer, when the lake is open water. But, there is nothing like the intensity, challenge and outdoor experience of ice fishing. \nYet, I must admit, that it is something I have never done. I observe it every year, but have no interest in bundling up in layers of warm clothing topped with a hood and knit hat and sitting out on a frozen lake waiting for the fish to bite.\nThat takes a special person, and it is not me. \nInterestingly, the next morning, a Saturday, when I went, as usual, at 6:30 a.m. to Hogan’s Hut to get the newspaper, there were pickup trucks and fishermen everywhere buying everything from bait, to fishing tackle, to breakfast sandwiches. The word was out...the lake was open for ice fishing!\nOf course, what the whole experience reveals again is the overwhelming appeal of Chautauqua Lake as a fishing resource and outdoor sporting destination. It has always amazed me how this highly-used lake continues to be such an excellent fishery...even in the heart of winter.\nIt looks now like we could be at the start of an “old-fashioned” winter. We have had a lot of snow—the Village of Mayville website says 89 inches so far, and more cold and snow is expected. We have already seen snowmobiles zipping down the frozen lake... another outdoor “magnet” for those who enjoy winter.\nWhen they come, the snowmobilers give way to the ice fishermen, who have been there first and staked out their claim to what the lake can give. There really isn’t any law, that I know of, regulating this—there is just mutual respect between the ice fishermen and snowmobile riders that they both can enjoy what the ice brings.\nAnd, for those of you who, like me, enjoy a warm fire instead of ice fishing—I would only suggest that you take a drive around the lake some sunny, cold day and look at what is going on. It is beautiful out there on the lake...even in the dead of winter!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

That local school kids can put on such an exceptional performance combined with all of the choreography and building of stage sets—is a great testament to our system of public education.\nAs a grandparent of kids so involved, it makes me not a disinterested observer. When I go to one of these performances, I am all in! I keep my handkerchief close by as I know that at some point in the performance, I am going to tear up.\nOne aspect of it all is that “musicals,” as we know them, are primarily an American phenomenon. They are a Broadway thing. People from all over the world come to New York every year just to experience the latest American musical.\nYou never know what the Broadway crowd is going to cook up. I was especially impressed a few years back when the musical “Hamilton” came out. I thought it would be a flop. How could anyone make a conservative “straight arrow” banker like Alexander Hamilton into a Broadway star? But they did it! It has been one of the biggest hits ever.\nFor the student participants in these local school musicals, the whole experience has to be unforgettable. Our grandson explained it this way:\n“When we first started rehearsing, nobody knew anything about the play, had never heard most of the songs, and many of us had never done a dance routine. We thought we could never pull it off. Then, one day, it hit us—we realized that we actually could do it. Then it all came together.” \nAnd did it ever! The standing ovation at the end, said it all. Handkerchiefs throughout the crowd came out of pockets. You would have thought it was Broadway itself.\nOf course, the unheralded hero in the whole show was the teacher/director who had taken this raw material of untested talent and molded it all into a show. The choreography, the beauty of the stage set, the lighting, the musical accompaniment, the singing—without a director, it wouldn’t have happened.\nThe “Americanness” of it all also hit me. Here we were, in a public school, in an audience coming from all different directions and outlooks, cheering and appreciating what these kids were doing. It was beautiful. You don’t find this happening in many foreign countries.\nSometimes, I find the storyline in these musicals to be a bit hoaky and syrupy. But that doesn’t matter. The power of music combined with a play—outside of opera, there is nothing that compares to it. \nKudos to our schools, kids, teachers, and parents for sponsoring again the Great American Musical!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "The Challenge of Neighborhood Renewal\nA friend recently dropped off a book about Jamestown’s “Lost Neighborhood,” the old Italian-American neighborhood that was located along the Chadakoin River adjacent to Harrison Street. I remember this neighborhood well, as I used to trek through it when walking to or from Jamestown High School.\n“Twenty-twenty” hindsight often resolves nothing, so I tread lightly when I say that “it would have been better had Brooklyn Square been rebuilt without destroying this community.” But, it was done. Can we learn from the experience?\nIt has been my view, over the years, that the old industrial and commercial buildings that constituted much of the area of Brooklyn Square, were likely beyond repair and the City needed to remove them, start over, and reopen the river so it could be seen again. But, what was gained by taking down the small homes around Derby Street, an important residential ethnic neighborhood?\nAdmittedly, the time of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s were “heady ones” when it came to urban planning. Most of the cities of the nation were getting old, so a national urban renewal program was initiated. It affected communities across the country, including Jamestown.\nThat whole era makes me think of today… of neighborhoods today, of what we are doing to insure their future. It is not just a matter of what is happening in the cities. Neighborhoods happen in villages, in suburban communities and even in the country.\nI have grandchildren growing up in these neighborhoods. They are making friends, going to school, playing sports and making life-long friends. We all should be thinking and hoping that 20 years from now, these will be places for them to return to, to repeat the experience.\nWe usually hear more about housing demolitions than replacement or new housing. Housing, especially in the cities, is a challenge because the lots there are often small. Because of that, any new or replacement housing likely needs to be built on a smaller footprint. Yet, it may also be possible to replace houses by combining lots…thus enabling one-story, handicapped accessible housing to be built.\nI mention this latter approach, as older people (like me) need to have things on one floor. Climbing stairs is not a good option. Most two-story houses around here have a kitchen and living area on the first floor…but the bedrooms and bath are upstairs.\nHopefully, city fathers and the housing people in places like Albany and Washington, also realize this. Keeping elderly citizens in their homes can help keep neighborhoods together. The City of Jamestown recently announced a pilot program to make the renovation of existing housing more affordable. We will have to wait and see how that develops.\nOf course, good schools also help stabilize neighborhoods. There is a lot that goes into it. The beauty and stability of growing up in a good neighborhood is of irreplaceable value. We need to keep figuring out how to keep doing it.\nThis is what will keep our kids and their kids coming back here to live.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Thanksgiving and Deer Season\nIt is Thanksgiving and another deer season is upon us. Many around here will likely spend some time at deer camp that day. In reflecting back, though I have no historical proof of it, I have always thought that the pilgrims likely ate venison along with turkey on that first Thanksgiving Day.\nLooking forward to deer season, I guess, is part of my DNA. I was once Chairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and Wildlife in the State Assembly. Every year we would have discussions with the DEC Division of Fish and Wildlife about setting the fish and wildlife seasons in New York, including the big game season. \nIn full disclosure, you should also know that I have a Lifetime Sportsman License (which I purchased some years ago) to hunt and fish in the State of New York. I used to be at deer camp every year on opening day. Mobility issues and age have changed that, but I still have great memories of those days.\nThough many may not realize it, we need a deer season. The size of the deer heard needs to be balanced with the resources available to support its population. This is why there are various deer management units around the state. The New York State DEC issues additional permits to take antlerless deer (also called doe permits) depending on the size of the deer herd in those areas.\nUrban dwellers are now feeling the effects of what happens when there are too many deer. Just ask residents of Jamestown or Lakewood. Deer are not dumb. They go where the eating is good and where they will not be bothered by hunters.\nIf we lived in a nonhuman environment, mother nature would maintain a balance in the deer population—predators like wolves and coyotes combined with disease and the weather would naturally contain and limit the size of the deer herd.`\nSince we don’t live in such a pristine environment anymore, it is up to we humans to help balance the deer population—that is why we have a deer season and regulations governing the harvesting of deer.\nEven if you don’t like guns, you will have to admit that it is better that deer be taken and used for food rather than seeing them hit by a car and laying alongside the road.\nDeer hunters are a special breed. They understand all of this and are some of the most protective conservationists I have ever met. To them, the woods and the deer are sacrosanct. \nOften, I will ask them: “Did you get a deer yet?” And, the answer will be: “Well, I saw a couple, but I am waiting for the big one.” What they are really saying is that they love being in the woods and are taking their time because they want to stay there as long as they can.\nI can remember the days when the deer population around here was very low. I also remember when there were no turkey to be found, but the pheasant hunting was good. Times and the wildlife environment have changed. Now, there too many deer, and turkey, not pheasants, abound.\nIt is our common obligation to keep the wildlife populations in balance. To my ears, gunshots in the woods this time of year mean not only that deer season has started, but, also, that winter is right around the corner.\nHaving a hunting season for deer is a good thing. Happy Thanksgiving to all!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, N.Y",

      "text": "Tariffs Are A Hidden Pre-Sales Tax\nWe all know about sales taxes. You buy something, like a car, you add 8% to that and then the car is yours. \nWe don’t like sales taxes, and, honestly, taxes are not something anyone really likes. But, sales taxes are the prime source of revenue for state and local government here, they have been approved by legislative bodies in counties and by the state legislature, and we know what they are and what they are for.\nTariffs, at least the ones now being imposed by the President in Washington, have been approved by no act of Congress, seem to change daily at his whim, and we are not sure what the new tax money will pay for except, perhaps, for interest on the growing national debt.\nBut, the slickest political side to tariffs is that they are hidden. Let’s say a carpet comes into the Port of New York made in Vietnam. The federal government slaps a 20% tariff on it, it gets shipped here, unbeknownst to you the price you pay for the carpet goes up 20% ,and then the carpet merchant levies an 8% sales tax on top of that.\nAt least we know about the 8% sales tax which is added at the time of sale. Tariffs, though, are added before the sale. They are a front-loaded, pre-sales tax. The money going to the federal government is never declared to the consumer. It is hidden and becomes a part of the sales price. Consumers just have to eat it as an increased cost of buying a carpet or of most imports coming into the country.\nWhat is also hidden is how tariffs hit the economy at various levels. A car from Japan, school clothes from Bangladesh, cell phones from India, furniture from China, steel from South Korea...you name it , and people are or will be paying 10%-50% more for depending upon what the President decides. A couple of weeks ago President Trump announced a 35% tariff on Canadian goods coming into the country.\nThe beauty of tariffs in Washington is that it is a tax that nobody has to vote on. It is a wonderful system if you are trying to stay under the political radar. It also brings needed money into the federal treasury which just got whacked with another $3 trillion in projected deficit increases because of the “Big Beautiful Bill” that was passed.\nThe selling job that the President has been pushing is promising that all of this will bring jobs back to the U.S.A. Yet, nothing much is said about the fact that the economy is already at or near full employment, and workers are hard to find for the jobs that are now available.\nMany economists believe that the Hawley-Smoot tariffs imposed in 1930 in the name of protecting American jobs only worsened the national depression. We are not yet there, but it is hard not to believe that this current wave of tariffs will have negative results. (It wasn’t that long ago that the Republican philosophy in Washington was to create more jobs through international trade and in opening foreign markets to U.S. goods.)\nThe Federal Reserve Bank has held off on further lowering interest rates because of a worry that the increased cost of consumer goods could drive up inflation. We are in a “wait and see” mode right now as to how the economy will go.\nYet, even if you like tariffs and support the President’s rather whimsical way of imposing them—the fact that they are hidden from public view should gall you. Also, the way that they are being unilaterally imposed is akin to what in the past was called “taxation without representation”... an approach to government that Americans have been known to dislike.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

It is expected that most if not all remaining septic systems between Stow and Prendergast point will be replaced by public sewers this year.\nThe final piece around the lake that had been missing was the area on the east side of the lake from Dewittville down to Midway State Park. Recently, however, the county received a financial commitment of $19 million from the New York State Environmental Facilities Corporation to complete that section.\nHurray, I would say! Congratulations to the county and to all who have been involved in the effort to complete sewers around the lake.\nNow that the financing is in place, the usual spadework has to be done to create a sewer district extension in this area. Detailed engineering drawings must be completed, and all of the other details put in place so that bidding can take place and the work begun. Commencement of work on this last phase of sewer construction is estimated to begin in 2027 and be completed by 2029.\nThe grant commitment recently received from New York State is a significant achievement. Without this funding, such a project would have been unaffordable for local residents.\nWe have come a long way in cleaning up Chautauqua Lake. I can still remember the days when pipes when directly from toilets into the lake. Improved septic systems have helped. Yet, it is nearly impossible to have effective septic systems when you have homes built on 100 ft. lots located right next to each other along the lake shore.\nOf course, sewers around the lake are just one piece of the ongoing challenge of managing Chautauqua Lake. When it is all done, we will still have a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake which heats up in the summertime. This means that weeds and algae blooms will continue to be a part of our life.\nFortunately, research being led by the Jefferson Project and the Army Corps of Engineers is continuing so that future actions relative to the lake will be based more on science and less on guess work. \nWe live on a highly used lake, and it doesn’t stop with the end of summer. Now, in winter, you see dozens of ice fishing tents, snow mobiles and cross-country skiers out on the ice.\nIt is no wonder that close to 40% of the property valuation in the county comes from the five townships that border the lake.\nSo, congratulations to the county and to all who worked on finding the funding for this last section to complete sewers around the lake. It is a major achievement and all who live around or near the lake will benefit from it for years to come.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

It is a proposal that should be considered.\nI can still remember the day when then Governor Andrew Cuomo went to Dunkirk and promised a big crowd that the plant would be converted from coal to natural gas...a plan that never got off the ground.\nWhat you see now, still looming over the Dunkirk harbor, is the shell of the former coal/electric plant. It is doubtful that a natural gas plant would need be housed in such a big structure...but these are matters that could be resolved. What is important is that the basic infrastructure of transmission, rights-of-way and a connection to the grid are still available.\nA preliminary study was also done around the time of Cuomo’s visit confirming that sufficient supplies of natural gas could be arranged by National Fuel Gas including likely a connection to the Tennessee Gas Pipeline that transits the northern part of Chautauqua County.\nThere has also been support given to the idea of converting the Dunkirk site into a nuclear power plant location. I support nuclear power generation, but, unless things change, this would likely be a long-term project—not one which would address the immediate needs of beefing up the New York State power grid.\nThe whole issue relative to the Dunkirk power plant brings to the forefront the reality that quickly converting everything to non-fossil fuel is just not possible. There needs to be a balanced approach toward energy which takes into consideration its cost to the consuming public.\nAt a minimum, the Public Service Commission, or a state agency, should conduct a study to determine whether the Dunkirk site could be used again in some way. Once it is all torn down, leveled and everything removed...it will be too late.\nMy only cautionary note in all of this is that false promises and false hopes should not be given again to the residents of the City of Dunkirk. They have had enough of that.\nEven if a new natural gas generated electric plant is built, we will never be returning to the days when the electric plant paid about half the property taxes in Dunkirk. Those days are over.\nThere would undoubtedly be a tax or payment in lieu of taxes agreement if such a facility were built, which would help fund local government. Yet, citizens should not be led to believe that this would solve all of the financial problems that Dunkirk is experiencing. Dealing with those issues is another matter altogether.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

The community is now beginning to understand just how long and how significant this public works job has become.\nOne positive development for the driving public is that a new temporary exit has been built so that traffic can exit onto Rt. 430 on the east side of the bridge. This has made it a bit more difficult for construction crews, as most all of them will now need to access the site from the west side or Stow side of the bridge.\nYet, the addition of this exit should help ameliorate complaints in Bemus that bridge construction has financially hurt businesses in that area.\nThis, of course, has brought up the whole matter of whether government should reimburse private businesses for lost revenue.\nAs to that idea, I hope that the county will go slow in considering whether to appropriate tax dollars for that purpose. There is always going to be business disruption when public works are being built or repaired. Yet, when it is over, businesses located nearby could likely become stronger and even more profitable. Would then the government have an obligation to recoup its money?\nThis may be a “can of worms” that the county should avoid getting into. In the end, the new bridge is going to benefit everyone, including those whose businesses are closest to it.\nAs to progress on the bridge, it has slowed down a bit because of a lack of steel reinforcement bar (“rebar.”) It is not clear if this has occurred because of the new steel tariffs that are affecting the market, or if was just a “foul-up” by the state or the company supplying the steel.\nIn any event, for most of August there has been no new concrete decking laid because steel rebar has not been available. It is hoped that by September, rebar will again start being delivered to the site.\nIn the meantime, the jobs of chipping, painting, and fixing potholes in order to get ready for the winter have been moving along. \nNight closures have been the “order of the day” recently, and the bridge has been closed in a least one direction on many days from 9 or 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. Thus, if you are heading home to Bemus, Jamestown or Randolph from Erie at night—you had better be checking the bridge closing times, or you might be taking a detour through Mayville or Lakewood in order to get home.\nNext year, there will be even more inconveniences when the lanes on the north side of the bridge go under construction. That means that those of us who want to get off at Stow as we head west, will need to go to the next exit at Stedman in order to exit the highway...another inconvenience. \nBut, take heart, soon enough this will all end, and we will have another big, beautiful, four-lane bridge that we can drive over for, at least hopefully, the next 50 years!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "On the Lake—Phase II Sewer Construction Gearing Up\nThe County Executive’s office recently announced that a bid had been approved by the Sewer District to commence construction on a Phase II project which will complete sewers on the west side of Chautauqua Lake.\nThis project has been long in planning starting with then County Executive, Vince Horrigan, in 2013. Subsequently, County Legislator Pierre Chagnon, Sewer District officials, the current County Executive and other civic leaders have taken the reins to see the project through. Public infrastructure projects like this take a long time to complete. An idea which started over ten years ago is still being implemented today.\n“Why so long?” you might ask. The quick answer is that public projects like this are long-term in nature, and also take time to get financed and approved. Think about expanding or creating a District, then submitting that for approval, then completing design/engineering documents including cost estimates and, finally, waiting for state and federal grant programs to be created in order for the project to actually become affordable for local residents. \nUnderlying all of this were questions like “where will the collected sewage go?” “How will it be transported?” “What size pumping and pipeline system will be required?” All of this takes time. \nIn general, the public supports such needed infrastructure. At the same time, the average person just wants to see it done and doesn’t think much about the details of it. In the case of sewage, people just want to be sure the toilet flushes. After that, it is somebody else’s problem.\nAs with other utilities, a sewer system needs to be planned for the peak day…not just the average day. The population around the lake likely triples during the summer months when people are vacationing here. A sewer system has to be designed so that it will work in July when the lake is at its busiest. Yet, it must also work on its slowest day, which could be in the middle of January.\nOn slow days In the winter, you don’t want pipes or systems freezing or sewage becoming stagnant because of slow flow rates. In short, it takes good planning, engineering and, in the end, sufficient money…to get it all done.\nFortunately, on the money end, the Sewer District was diligent in seeking enough federal and state grant assistance so that Phase II, as bid, is expected to meet financial projections. It is about a $17 million dollar job and will connect the end of the existing line at Stow to an already sewered area at Prendergast Point near the Fish Hatchery. \nIt is clear, especially when viewing the shoreline from a boat, that sewers were needed. Small lots 50-100 ft. wide situated close together along the lake—just don’t have the space to contain both a working septic system and a consistently safe water well. Now, that problem will be solved. \nConstruction will start this winter, continue through 2026 and is expected to be completed in 2027. Thanks to all who were involved in reaching this milestone… a project which will help preserve Chautauqua Lake for future generations!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

There are jobs that cannot be done at home using only a computer and an internet connection.\nIt is not just dental work; it is most medical work. Patients have to be seen; the sick have to be taken care of. As to teaching, effective education requires that teachers be in a classroom. In the winter, snowplows actually must be operated by snowplow drivers, etc.\nAs to manufacturing, you can’t produce truck engines (think Cummins) without a work force doing it. If you go out to eat, it requires a cook and a waitress. Carpenters are required to build a house. A bridge cannot be rebuilt without the construction workers to do it. And, yes, despite automation, human beings actually have to be involved when cows are being milked. \nNot everything can be done by computer. There is a lot that can’t be done by just asking “Siri” or “Alexa” to do it. \nThe band Alabama has a song which goes right to this point titled “Forty Hour Week For A Livin’.” Here is one verse from those lyrics:\n “This is for the one who drives the big rig\nUp and down the road\nOr the one out in the warehouse\n Bringing in the load \n Or the waitress, the mechanic\nThe policeman on patrol\nFor everyone who works behind the scenes\nWith a spirit you can’t replace with no machine.”\nAnd then the song ends with this: “Hello America, let me thank you for your time.”\nSometimes it’s good to reflect on the human requirements that keep our society moving. All of this talk about Artificial Intelligence (AI} and more automation for everything sounds good...but there are tasks that can only be done by our fellow men and women. Even the orders taken and processed by AI, have to be delivered in a cardboard box by someone driving a van who takes the item ordered to the customer.\nAs to 40 hours a week, that is just a wish for many who are working to make ends meet. There are a lot of people working out there behind the scene, that can’t be replaced “with no machine.” We need to be mindful and grateful for that. \nHello, America...let me thank you for your time!\nRolland Kidder \nStow, NY",

This has been the case where some, alleging that it would improve the environment, have been pushing to stop the use of all natural gas in our state.\nJust think what that would mean? The largest source of the energy now generating electricity in the state would be cut-off. The cleanest fossil fuel that we have would be shut down. And, if you live in a place like Western New York, you would have to find a new way to heat your home. In Albany, even the Capitol would go cold.\nThis anti-natural gas policy is nonsense. Not only is it bad public policy, it would devastate the state and cripple the electric grid if these policies were to be carried out.\nI would characterize New York State as being duplicitous and two-faced on the issue. In the name of cleaning up the environment, we abolished the ability to explore and produce natural gas in the state. The DEC won’t give permits anymore to drill and explore for natural gas to allow for drilling in the shale, which is an immense resource in the state, especially in the Southern Tier.\nOn the other hand, our state, including counties downstate and the City of New York, continue to consume great quantities of natural gas. As the old saying goes: “We want to have our cake and eat it to,” though in this case it is natural gas we are talking about. Though we won’t produce it, we want others to do so and send it to us for our energy needs.\nWhat keeps the lights on in New York City right now is that there are still some old natural gas peaking plants which get turned on, on very cold days or on hot summer days when the air-conditioning load is high and more electricity is required.\nWe could have more efficient peaking plants in New York City, but “No,” that would violate our state-imposed mandate to stop using natural gas. So, we keep using the old, less efficient gas turbine peaking plants. All in the name of cleaning up the environment. \nSuch policies are, of course, nuts...but, it happens, here in New York!\nAnd, what about installing a natural gas generator so that you can have power in your house if the electrical grid does fail? I expect that the “deep thinkers” in Albany and New York will soon find a way to try and stop that as well.\nThe ultimate reality for me, of course, comes here at home. Our furnace and hot water are heated by natural gas. Gas is a much more efficient fuel in producing heat than electricity...but who cares about that?\nThen there is the fact that a few years ago, we put in a small but very efficient natural gas stove. My back has gotten older and no longer wants to stoke a wood stove. But now, at least, I have the alternative of putting my feet up, putting the recliner back, pushing a button and then watching a beautiful blue flame heat the room and most of the house.\nThey are “barking up the wrong tree” when they start threatening to take natural gas away. More people are starting to understand that, though, I expect, it will take a few more elections and some energy interruptions before the situation ultimately gets turned around.\nSomeday, they may find a way to transport hydrogen or some other fuel safely to my home. But, in the meantime, I am sticking with the blue flame!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

It is not just people traveling to Chautauqua for its programs, it is people from Chautauqua heading for Lakewood to shop and buy groceries. \nYou just have to get used to the traffic. It is best to slow down when you get on the road, and to expect that it may take you a minute or two longer to get to your destination. This is especially the case as there are now stoplight restrictions related to construction work on the new sewer extension.\nThere have been complaints from the Sherman’s Bay area around Lakewood that the weeds there are bad this year. This, despite the fact that the area was treated with herbicide. It seems the wind and rain this year must have combined to push weeds into the bay. \nWeeds are nothing new on Chautauqua Lake. It has been and always will be a eutrophic, shallow lake where weeds like to grow. Also, the southern basin of lake is shallower and so weeds tend to be more of a problem there. The weather and mother nature will continue to be the determining factor in much of what we experience on the lake. \nBut human efforts to improve the lake are substantial. The Chautauqua Lake Association continues to harvest and dispose of weeds, the Chautauqua Lake Partnership continues its efforts at herbicide treatment, and the Chautauqua Lake Property Owner’s Association continues to spearhead efforts to challenge the new wetland regulations which could impede property ownership rights on the lake.\nIn addition, the Chautauqua Lake Watershed Conservancy continues its focus on preserving undeveloped portions of the lake, and there is an ongoing research program called the Jefferson Project conducting scientific research on the lake. \nTo help bring it all together, there is a county-sponsored coordinating organization, the Chautauqua Lake and Watershed Management Alliance, which works to assist and help finance various lake-related organizations. The common interest of all of these groups is the health and maintenance of this beautiful body of water which dominates the center of Chautauqua County.\nFinally, there is now a new, significant “player” involved in lake issues—the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They have just begun a multi-year study on how algae growth is affecting our lake, trying to understand it better, and, ultimately, finding ways to combat it. The Army Corps has more experience and more money in dealing with the inland lakes and rivers in this country than any other organization—so it is a plus that they are now involved.\nIn short, there are a lot “moving parts” when it comes to Chautauqua Lake. This also means that a lot people are involved. There are hundreds of citizens out there who are interested in the future of this lake...and that is a good thing!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

There has also been a lot of new concrete decking laid—especially on the Bemus side.\nThere had been some concern about the potential movement of steel as the weight of the old concrete was removed. There is always some movement when this is done as there is some flex in all steel. \nIn crossing the bridge, you may have observed the various measuring devices on tripods that have been positioned there. They have been measuring the movement or rebound of the steel.\nMy understanding is that all the measurements have been well within tolerances for structural steel like that of the girders underpinning the Chautauqua Lake Bridge. The DOT has been diligent in measuring this. Apparently, a model of the bridge and its weight-bearing characteristics was actually built to replicate the process of removing the weight of concrete during reconstruction.\nAs to what you will see as you cross the bridge this winter—not much will change. The season for laying concrete decking is pretty much over. It can only be laid within certain temperature tolerances, and with cold weather coming...that will end the pouring of concrete decking for this season.\nThat does not mean that all construction work will cease. There is still a lot of steel and concrete chipping repair going on beneath the surface of the bridge. It is expected that this will continue at least until the snow or cold shuts it down.\nThe traveling public on the highway can see little of this subsurface work. Even if you pass below the bridge in a boat, you can see very little because of the temporary construction subdeck that has been installed.\nOne final note on the bridge. I don’t believe that there is another bridge in Upstate New York like the one we have which spans our lake. There are bridges to Canada over the Niagara River and on the St. Lawrence, and some other large bridges that cross the Hudson River.\nBut, there is nothing quite like the Chautauqua Lake Bridge in all of Upstate. \nI am sure that there are truckers headed east to New York who get to Erie, Pennsylvania and then say: “What the heck, it may take a bit more fuel going through the hills, but I think I’ll take I-86 so that I can see that incredible view of the lake from that bridge!”\nMaybe that was in the heads of people like Bill Hennessy, the Wellsville guy who headed up the DOT in Albany at the time of its construction. I can just see Hennessy telling the DOT engineers at that time—“We are going to build a big bridge over a magnificent lake in the area of the state that I came from—so make it beautiful!”\nAnd, they did!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

It was not a job that he really wanted—he was plenty busy running the farm—but the Republican Committee asked him to run for the position, so he did.\nAfter a couple of terms, a neighboring dairy farmer, a Democrat, Frank Bratt, decided to run for the job. My Dad’s reaction was: “Well, if he wins, he will do a good job.” Bratt did win, and I remember my father saying shortly thereafter: “I guess I’d better get the Town books over to Frank so that he can get familiar with things,”—and he took the Town record books that he had over to Frank’s house.\nRecently, in this newspaper, there have been a couple of local government stories—one good and one not so good.\nThe “not so good” story dealt with the resignation of some local officials in the Village of Cassadaga over what seemed to be personal attacks or criticism of a project that had been undertaken by the Village. Some opposed to the project had made life so miserable for some village officials that they decided to resign. A sad tale indeed.\nYet, there was another recent story of a local government which had been through a lot of scrutiny and public criticism over a proposed project, and their approach was to continue to hold hearings and meetings to address concerns to try to find a solution.\nThat local government was the Town of Chautauqua, and the project dealt with developing the old and now abandoned golf course at Point Chautauqua.\nSuch projects are always contentious as many residents would prefer to leave things just the way they are.\nYet, local government has an obligation to do more than just block development—it needs to provide guidance for development...and the Town of Chautauqua has now done that. Not everyone will be happy, but town officials are doing their job as it was meant to be.\nThe Town of Chautauqua surrounds the northern end of Chautauqua Lake and, in 2025 had a total assessed property value of $1.5 billion—representing about13% of the total assessed value of the whole county. Growth in the value of real estate is happening there—and town officials should be given credit for taking on the important task of helping shape that development.\nIn many ways, being a locally elected official is not easy. Many of the calls that they get are from people complaining about things. At times, local government can seem like a thankless job.\nYet, local officials are doing important work, and we should be grateful when they are willing to “roll up their sleeves” and undertake the hard and challenging work of helping shape our future.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

That changed when Brian Higgins from Erie County, through redistricting, became our Congressman.\nHiggins lived close by, in Buffalo, and I liked and knew Congressman Higgins. But, I must admit, I have always preferred a congressional district centered on the Southern Tier. Someone who lives in Elmira, Corning or even Binghamton, I think senses more the unique challenges that this district of primarily rural and small town constituents has in common.\nThe idea of “Southern Tier” has been redefined now with our current Congressman, Nick Langworthy, living in Niagara County.\nIt is not that Langworthy doesn’t “know” the Southern Tier...he grew up in South Dayton. It is just the fact that a precedent seems to have been set that the home of our Congressman can be moved to any location as long as it represents a safe Republican District. \nCould our Congressman or Congresswoman come from, let’s say, Syracuse?

My other concern deals with the matter of their willingness to express opinions which may be contrary to what the President wants to hear. \nOne of the more recent biographies of Lincoln was titled “Team of Rivals.” In it, the author detailed how President Lincoln intentionally appointed people to top positions who he knew would speak their mind, even if it meant disagreeing with the President.\nPerhaps, the best example in Lincoln’s cabinet was his appointment of William H. Seward as Secretary of State. Seward, who once lived here in Westfield, had competed with Lincoln to become President. He was also a former Governor of New York and a leader in the abolitionist wing of the Republican Party... whereas as Lincoln was more moderate in his views.\nThese differences didn’t matter to Lincoln. He wanted a person with strong views, governmental experience, and an independent voice in that office. Seward came as advertised and was always willing to tell the President “No” when he thought he was wrong.\nAnother strong personality in the cabinet was Salmon P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury. Chase had been Governor of Ohio and always thought that he should have been President, not Lincoln. He was so independent that he would sometimes criticize Lincoln behind his back. Lincoln knew this, but valued Chase because of his ability to raise funds to support the Union during the Civil War.\nAnother independent personality was the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton. Stanton was a Democrat, and often at odds with Mr. Lincoln. Lincoln didn’t care. Stanton was a man who could bridge political gaps, raise an Army and then focus the military efforts needed to carry on the war. \nThese three men were also often at odds even with each other, but Lincoln encouraged that. He did not want “yes men” around him. He wanted individuals who were respected by their peers in government and would speak truth to power.\nI could be wrong but, at first blush, these characteristics seem to be lacking in many of our next President’s picks for top positions in our government. Most of them seem to have been chosen because of their vowed fealty to Mr. Trump rather than their qualification for high office. \nTrump’s first Attorney General pick was so enmeshed in personal problems and with the ultra-right wing of his party, that even colleagues in his own party in the Congress tried to avoid him. A discredited Democrat who has fringe ideas on health has been proposed to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe first choice to lead Education is a former executive for World Wrestling Entertainment. As to the military, though a veteran, we are looking at a former Fox News personality with a rather blemished reputation and no experience working with the Pentagon to be our next Secretary of Defense.\nWe really haven’t seen anything quite like this in our history. Let’s hope that clearer heads in the Senate can prevail when confirmation time comes.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

Yet, the DOT did its job. The snow removal during this very harsh winter was successful. Narrower plows were used to plow the snow, and, of course, a lot of salt had to be applied to keep the two lanes open and safe. There were no major accidents that I know of, and traffic generally moved slowly and smoothly over the bridge.\nNow that the weather has broken, construction crews are back, special concrete is being poured to encapsulate and protect sections where the girders meet, and demolition has begun on the bridge decking on the southeast side near the shore at Bemus.\nWhat we don’t know is what will be the ultimate plan for the total removal and replacement of the bridge deck. Last year, concrete removal on the southwest side of the bridge was discontinued so that further evaluation could be done as to the best way to complete demolition of the old bridge deck during reconstruction.\nThere was some engineering concern expressed as to possible imbalance/torque issues as weight was lessened by the removal of the concrete decking.\nWe have not heard from the DOT, but it appears from recent activity that the plan must be to pour new decking after the old sections are removed so that construction vehicles and crews will have access and a platform to work from as bridge reconstruction moves along. \nWe do know at this point that new bearings have been installed under most of the girders on the south side of the bridge, though not, apparently, on the arched center section.\nAs to the request of the Village of Bemus Point to have a study conducted on the feasibility of including a walkway/bikeway as part of the project, nothing has been heard.\nMotorists, for the most part, have been diligent in slowing down and observing the yield signs on the entrance ramps in Bemus and Stow. I have also heard that a lot of speeding tickets have been issued for those exceeding the 40-mph limit. Slowing down is critical in ensuring that entering traffic does not collide with through traffic at either end of the bridge.\nIt would be helpful if the DOT held regular updates on the bridge’s reconstruction. Such periodic updates would be welcomed by the traveling public, especially by those who live near the bridge and use it on a daily basis. (Which, by inference and disclaimer, I must admit, includes myself.) In the meantime, we have to draw our own conclusions primarily from what we can observe.\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Chautauqua Lake Bridge Update\nFor those who use the Chautauqua Lake Bridge on a daily basis, there has been recent good news—there is now a “temporary” exit ramp for Bemus Point on the eastbound lane just as you cross the bridge.\nBusinesses in Bemus and the Village had been asking that this be done, and, to its credit, the State DOT made the decision to do so.\nIt complicates things a bit for workers and contractors who had been accessing the bridge from the east side. They will now have to come in from the west side in order to avoid traffic using the new exit ramp. But, the new arrangement, thus far, seems to be working.\nThe bridge has also been shut down on many nights to facilitate the work going on...at least some of the work being related to patching the two lanes now being used. Some closures have started as early as 9 p.m. which can be a “headache” for those using the bridge. But, the most recent closing notices have been for shorter hours, like 3 a.m. to 6 a.m., making it easier for the traveling public using I-86. \nThere has been a noted slow-down in the past couple of weeks with the pouring of new concrete decking for the section now being reconstructed. Apparently, this is being caused by a shortage of steel reinforcement bar (rebar) which must be installed before the concrete deck can be poured.\nIt is not clear whether this shortage was a “foul-up” in ordering, whether the supplier just ran out of it, or whether it could be related to a shortage in rebar caused by the new tariffs on steel. But, whatever the cause, it is real. The latest I have heard is that the contractor expects this material to begin arriving again in September so that the pouring of new concrete decking can again proceed.\nThis week did see the commencement of demolition of more old concrete on the south side of the bridge, so progress is being made.\nThere have also been news reports that some are seeking monetary compensation for lost revenue due to the bridge reconstruction. As a state and federal project, perhaps there is some provision in state or federal law to make up for lost revenue experienced by nearby businesses. But, I hope that the County goes slowly in appropriating local tax dollars for this purpose. \nThere are always impacts when major public works projects of this kind are undertaken. Yet, in the end, new infrastructure, like a new bridge, benefits everyone. If the County were to start reimbursing local businesses for construction-related lost revenue—where would it end? If a business doubles its income after the project is completed, should then the County come in and try and recoup these expenditures?\nIt seems to me that such a program could become a real “can of worms” and open the County and its taxpayers to all kinds of financial claims related not only to the Chautauqua Lake Bridge but to any future bridge, highway or other infrastructure projects that come along. There are already enough demands on the public purse in Mayville.\nAs to the bridge itself, winter is coming. There are still two or three years to go before this project is completed. The days are getting shorter, and soon our beloved snow will again be falling. So, let’s hope for a nice fall which will help those working on the bridge get as much done as they can in 2025!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Bridge Reconstruction Ramps Up\nI don’t know if you have observed it, but it looks to me like there are at least double the number of people as usual now working on the Chautauqua Lake bridge. It is obvious that the contractor is taking advantage of the good weather and reconstruction work is ramping up.\nWhat you see visually is that new decking is proceeding on the south side of the bridge coming from both ends of the bridge towards the middle. I don’t know all of the engineering reasons, but it seems to make common sense, as this is the way the original bridge was built, i.e. after the girders were placed, the decking and concrete paving started from both sides of the bridge moving towards the middle. \nIt seems that many of the additional people now on the bridge are painters. To reduce corrosion, the girders and steel work are being painted. They had not been painted before. \nThe bright, shiny steel surface that is now visible is what I would call the “sub-decking.” It is the “floor,” if you will, upon which rebar followed by concrete will be laid. \nThis past week, the lighted signs on either side of the bridge have indicated that the bridge will be closed from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on certain nights. Such closures are needed when the current open two-lanes are required to bring in steel, concrete or other materials needed in the reconstruction. Some of this current night work is related to the continuing job of pouring special, corrosion-resistant concrete where the girders meet the supporting columns.\nAs to the night closures, I give credit to the DOT and contractor for alerting the public. As I never go over the bridge in the middle of the night, it doesn’t affect me. But, a trucker heading from Chicago to Boston who may want to use I-86 in the middle of the night needs to know when the bridge is going to be closed. \nThe DOT hasn’t announced it, but it would appear that the original idea of replacing the two lanes on the south side of the bridge first...and then shifting construction to two lanes on the north side is now being followed. One must assume that the last decking to be laid will be on the arched, center section of the bridge. \nMy wife has asked me, periodically, why I write so much about the bridge. I have tried to explain that I think it is a “guy” thing. Things mechanical, construction-related with engineering challenges have always engaged my interest. Whatever the reason, the whole project continues to interest me.\nThe cost, obviously, is going to be substantial. I cannot but think that there have been many change orders and unexpected repairs needed. Also, working nights, overtime, and some weekends adds additional expense. The “jury is still out,” but I would think that the deep-thinkers at the DOT in Albany are hoping that the reconstruction of the Chautauqua Lake Bridge doesn’t break their Interstate Highway budget.\nIf it does, it is for a good cause. We who live here and daily use this bridge realize that it has become an integral part of our community life. It has united communities which for years were separated by a 20-mile-long barrier of water. \nAs to the bikeway/walkway study being sought in connection with the bridge’s reconstruction, verbal communication with our Congressman’s office indicates that funds for this program were discontinued in 2023...so the prospects for such a study don’t look good.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Breaking Down The Barrier\nMost of my life has been lived in Chautauqua County, and, if there has been one common denominator or barrier throughout—it has been what we call the “ridge,” the Chautauqua Ridge which separates the South County from the North County.\nIt is a division originating in mother nature. It separates two major watersheds—that of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers. But, over the years, it became more than that. The people of Dunkirk, Westfield, or Fredonia could seem like distant neighbors to those who lived in Jamestown, Lakewood or Frewsburg. \nIt was no accident then that Mayville was chosen as the County Seat. It sits atop this ridge, somewhat in a neutral position, at the end of a famous portage which linked the two major watersheds. It also sits on the border between North and South County. It was closer to Lake Erie than to Jamestown, thus acceptable to the North. Yet, acceptable also to those in Jamestown in the South…after all, it was only a trolley or steamboat ride away for them to get to the Courthouse.\nAgriculture also defines these regions. With a longer growing season due to its lower elevation and closeness to Lake Erie, grapes and fruit dominate the North. Dairy and upland farming define the South.\nThe weather is also different. The Ridge causes updrafts of the westerly winds, cooling them as they rise more than 1,000 ft. in moving from Lake Erie into the hills of the Southern Tier. In the winter, this usually means more snow along the Ridge.\nPolitics has always tracked these differences between north and south. If, for example, the candidate for judge, in a given year, came from the South County—then, the next time around, it would be the North County’s turn to have the judgeship. Politics also reflects population—which has meant that the greater population south of the Ridge was a concern for those who lived north of it. The “big city” of Jamestown could seem overpowering to the smaller city of Dunkirk.\nOn the other hand, transportation advantages have always been in the North. Routes 5 and 20 followed by construction of the Thruway, along with having the mainline of two railroads, have kept communities along the Lake Erie shore in the transportation mainstream. Mainline rail service today doesn’t exist in the South County, and it wasn’t until the 1990’s that I-86 was finally finished, thus completing a transportation corridor across the Southern Tier.\nThen there were communication issues. For years, phone conversations between Jamestown and Dunkirk were long-distance calls which cost extra money. There were (and still are) different radio stations in North and South. Yet, the newspapers have changed—they are now owned by the same company and today are sharing, more-and-more, news items between them.\nThe good news doesn’t end there. Several years ago, the Chambers of Commerce in South and North merged, and recently, the United Way organizations announced that they were merging. \nYes, the Ridge is never going to go away. But, slowly, surely, things are coming together—and that is a good thing. The barrier is breaking down. After all, we do live in the same county!\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Back to the 50’s?\nIn the midst of all of day-to-drama surrounding the Trump White House, one thing seems to be constant—a culture war of sorts is going on.\nThere is always a battle of some kind going on or being generated. It is presented as a struggle of the “good guys” against the “bad guys,” and “never the twain shall meet.” There is not a search for consensus, but a “drawing of lines in the sand,”—we are right and you are wrong.\nAnd, everything is in the attack mode.\nSome of this, I think, goes back to Donald Trump’s relationship with a lawyer, Roy Cohn, whom he revered, and who advised him to always be on the attack and never admit wrong.\nCohn was a force to be reckoned with back in the 1950’s. He first made a name for himself as a lawyer working for Senator Joe McCarthy, the ultimately disgraced Senator who ruined a lot of lives by claiming that people were communists and subversives, when they weren’t.\nI was reminded of this history recently while re-reading Theodore White’s 1978 book In Search of History. White, along with many others who had served in the China Theater during the Second World War, had witnessed the corruption and ineffectiveness of Chiang Kae Shek’s Nationalist Chinese government and wrote about it. They also warned that the communists in China were very well organized, and more effective in fighting the Japanese than was Chiang’s government.\nJoe McCarthy accused those speaking the truth about China as being communists and anti-American. For a time, White’s passport was taken from him—just because he had spoken the truth about what was going on in China.\nThe famed reporter, Edward R. Murrow, finally exposed McCarthy for what he was—a liar and a headline-grabber. Eventually, he was derailed by President Eisenhower and then censured by the U.S. Senate.\nHowever, Roy Cohn, McCarthy’s lawyer, survived all of this, went back to New York and became a lawyer and litigator for the rich and famous of that time. Donald Trump’s father and Trump himself were clients and they revered Cohn for his the abrasive, aggressive, “I’m right and your wrong” approach to almost everything.\nIf Cohn were alive today, he would be neck-deep in all of the power grabs and personal attacks coming from the White House.\nIn the end, the McCarthy approach to life and the law finally fails...as it did when Mao Tse Tung’s Cultural Revolution in China finally died in 1976. The aggressors eventually turn on each other, progress goes in the wrong direction, there is an accounting...and, in time, society regains its sanity.\n“Going back to the 50’s” just won’t work over the long pull. Substance, truth, reason, and the rule of law will ultimately return again. America will move forward once again, and the nation will come together again.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

Because of the power of the Presidency, Democrats in high places essentially “rolled over,” hoped for the best, and didn’t act until it was too late.\nThey erred in so doing, and more viable candidates for the highest office in the land were thus thwarted in seeking that office. To put it bluntly, one of our major political parties failed the country. The power of the Presidency, the power of one—over-powered the normal political process of selecting a candidate for President.\nNow, we are compounding the problem by what seems to be the virtual abandonment of the Republican Party in opposing in any way the current President. Members of Congress, when President Trump says “Jump!”—they respond,“How high?!” \nThere appears to be little or no backbone in the Republican Congress when it comes to proposals from the White House. It can be 145% tariffs today, and 30% tariffs tomorrow. It can be taking a gift of half a billion dollars from a sheikh in Arabia so that our President can have a plush airplane with a gilded interior, or have him telling American Universities that they must parrot the messaging of the federal government or be shut down.\nWhatever comes out of the White House now is apparently infallible, and the law of the land is to be set by executive decree.\nHowever you look at it, I see in all of this a demeaning of our constitutional government. The Constitution was written to give the congress, the executive and the courts equal jurisdiction over our affairs as a nation. If any branch of the government was to have a leading role, it was to have been the congress through the power of the purse strings.\nNow we stand in awe, apparently as helpless as sheep, while in the dead of night the House of Representatives rubber stamps the White House by ripping down a great part of the government previously created by other Republican and Democratic administrations to pay for unneeded tax cuts accelerating the deficit. All put altogether in a “one big Beautiful Bill!”—whatever that means.\nI doubt that many members of Congress even knew what was in it. It was too much for at least one Republican member of the House from Long Island who fell asleep that night somewhere in halls of Congress and didn’t wake up for this monumental vote.\nIt seems that maybe the whole country is asleep. When will this end? It has taken over 200 years, through fits and starts, successes and failures, but, for the most part, with good intentions, to build this country making it the leader of the free world. \nNow we seem to be giving it all up to be ruled by a government of one. We shouldn’t be going down this road. This is not what made America great.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

We had been out of town, at one of our kids’ homes for the holiday. We drove back on Saturday in good weather and found two feet of snow in our driveway.\nFortunately, it had been plowed...thanks to the snowplow guy. \nWe tend to forget about what winter around here is like. We have had some easy ones, and, with four-wheel drive, you begin to think that you can drive through anything. Then comes the lake-effect snow. Thank God for the man who plows our driveway!\nThink though about what his life is like. He can’t take off for the week-end, unless he has a buddy who will fill in for him. He has to be ready to go at almost a moment’s notice. The weather man/woman is better at predicting the weather than they were years ago...thanks to the predictability of computer-generated weather modeling. But, still, around here, in snow country with lake effect snow...a lot of it can fall in a short time without a lot of notice.\nThen, think also of the investment. Snow plows today are not just an “up or down” relatively cheap mechanical machine. They have hydraulic controls which can collapse the plow into the form of a “V”, or direct on which side of the road to push the snow. And, the plow must be ready to go all winter even if there is not a lot of snow.\nThen, there is the “time of day” question. Who wants to get up at 3 or 4 a.m. and start plowing driveways so that others can get up and go to work at 6 or 7 a.m.? That takes a special kind of person. \nYou can’t stay up ‘til midnight and watch the late show, and then think you can jump in your truck and start plowing three or four hours later. Like everyone else, the snowplow guy needs his sleep.\nI grew up on a dairy farm and got used to getting up early to milk cows. On snowy days, after milking, we would plow the driveway. In those days we had a tractor with chains on it with a simple “up and down” plow to push the snow. The driveway needed to be plowed so that the milk hauler could get to the milkhouse to pick up the milk cans.\nI don’t milk cows anymore, but I am still an early riser and need to be plowed out. I know that Hogan’s Hut will open at 6 a.m. and I want to be there soon thereafter to buy the morning paper. \nSo sorry, Mr. Snowplow Driver. I am one of those guys that probably makes your life miserable in the early morning hours after a snowy night. Yet, I do appreciate what you do. Thanks for sticking around town, getting up early and doing your work so that the rest of us can travel and go on our way!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

It is quicker to take the Thruway to get home, but I always opt for the back roads and the expressway that threads through the hills of the Southern Tier.\nAs we came up the big hill heading west from Bath, the clouds were almost touching the ground as we came to the summit of the pass at Howard. When we passed Hornell, I said to my wife, “I think we will be in the clouds when we go over the Alfred-Almond Pass”...and at over 2,000 ft. above sea level we were.\nIt was a dramatic day to drive the Southern Tier Expressway. From Steuben County to home, the clouds hung like a draped cloth over the hills as the road wound its way west. \nAs we drove past the last sharp, almost-a-mountain hill, that juts up from the valley floor near Steamburg, I mentioned to her again about how the clouds were obscuring its top. I call this place “Mount Parment” after a friend who had the idea years ago that it would be wonderful place to build a magnificent Monticello-type home overlooking the valley floor and the expressway down below.\nThen, as we neared home rounding the bend right behind the Cheney farm and the Chautauqua Lake overlook service area, we again touched the bottom of the overcast. We came out of the cloud, slowed down and crossed the now two-lane Chautauqua Lake bridge from Bemus to Stow and were home.\nIt was one of those miraculous, cloud-filled days on the Southern Tier Expressway. \nThere are old, pre-expressway memories, now only remembered by a few. When I was in college, there was no expressway. It took about 2 hours to drive to Houghton, NY. Now, with the expressway, you can reach Route 19 near Belfast in a little over an hour. Houghton is just up the Genesee Valley from there.\nCharlie Henderson, a former Assemblyman from Steuben County, told me once that he was responsible for the northern loop that the expressway now takes going through Hornell, instead of following the route of old Rt. 17 through Wellsville. \nI don’t know if that is true, but I always thank Charlie (now deceased) when I climb those magnificent passes at Alfred/Almond and Howard which takes the Southern Tier Expressway past his old hometown. The views there are incredible no matter what the weather is.\nThere are a myriad of stories of how the Southern Tier Expressway was built. Most “tip their hat” to Senator Robert Kennedy who made sure that the 13 counties of the Southern Tier of New York were included when the Appalachian Regional Commission was formed. That federal agency became the source of much of the funding for the highway’s construction.\nAll of that, of course, is now ancient history. The highway is there. It transits one of the most varied landscapes on the Interstate Highway System, and those of us who live along it never get tired of the beautiful drive!\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",

Eisenhower, in describing who an American was.\nIke is purported to have said something along the line that: “Americans are people who enjoy having a barbecue in their own backyard.”\nIt sounds a bit “hoaky,” but I can envision him saying it, and it really does say a lot about who we are.\nWe like our free time and are good at having fun doing it. Whether you are at a ball game, out on your boat on the lake, or sitting down in the backyard having a barbecue—Americans like to enjoy themselves.\nIt also carries the story that we live in a country where we can enjoy ourselves. The government doesn’t tell us that we have to have a barbecue...that is our decision. We like our freedom and enjoy exercising it.\nThe idea of having our “own” backyard also helps define who we are. Owning a home or having a place that we call “home” is part of the American dream. \nWe like to attend parades and patriotic events, like fireworks on the 4th of July, but we put family and friends on even a higher plane—so, “let’s have a barbecue in the backyard and invite some friends over!”\nWe are lucky in that our front yard (which is really our “back yard,”) faces the lake. The other night we were cooking out, corn-hole and ladder ball were being played on the lawn, a couple of kids were throwing a football, the sun was setting over the lake and the old man in the group, me, was cooking at the grill observing it all.\nHow does it get any better than that?! \nI think that Eisenhower may have had a good thought going when he talked about having “a barbecue in the backyard.” \nHe also understood the importance of home when he was commanding American troops in Europe during the Second World War. He was giving orders that would take many of those young American boys to their graves.\nHe knew that they loved their country. He also knew that what motivated them most was getting the war over so that they could get back home...to that barbecue in the backyard.\nSometimes, it is the simplest things in life that can be the most motivating. Ike didn’t need to preach about what “home” meant to those troops...they already knew that. \nAnd, a big part of Eisenhower’s own story is that had grown up in a small town in Kansas where he had been given the freedom to have a barbecue at his home, in his own backyard.\nRolland Kidder\nStow, NY",
