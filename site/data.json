It was a\nwell-crafted, articulate analysis by the Prime Minister as to where the\nworld order was going under Trump’s leadership.\n\nPerhaps, the nub of that speech came when Carney warned that the United\nStates was now leading the world not into a “transition” to a new\ninternational system of governance but to a “rupture” in what we have\ncome to know since World War II as a system defined by the rule of law.\n\nCarney’s speech was not one of grievance, but one of stating the reality\nof what has been going on since Trump became President in 2025. The\nPresident of the United States has not only thrown Canada “under the\nbus,” he has openly criticized most of America’s former allies in one\nway or another.\n\nNoteworthy in Mr. Carney’s speech was that he didn’t stop at just\ndescribing the situation as he sees it, he offered a new approach–that\nit was time for the “middle powers” in the world, like Canada, to seek\nnew alliances between themselves to insure that democracy and the rule\nof law continue as the basis for international diplomacy.\n\nThe existing established order, which came out of World War II and was\nled by the United States, created international institutions and\nalliances to keep the peace. That order is now being shredded, and the\nworld can no longer count on the United States as it has in the past.\nCanada and other democracies are adapting to this new reality.\n\nAs an American, though I appreciated the brilliance and truthfulness of\nthe Prime Minister’s speech–it was a sad day. The Trump administration’s\n“go-it-alone” foreign policy now being applied with an arrogance that we\nhave never seen–has marginalized the United States on the world stage.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada spoke truth to power. We are forcing our\nformer allies to find new ways to keep the peace in order to preserve\ndemocracy in the world–what could be more tragic? Our “go it alone,”\nAmerica first (and only, it seems) strategy is destroying the\ncredibility of the United States of America.",

President Trump said:\n“Yeah, there is one thing. My own morality. My own mind. It is the only\nthing that can stop me.” His answer did not mention any Constitutional\nlimitations to his power.\n\nThe public now is beginning to understand this as reflected in the\nrecent “No Kings” demonstrations that sprung up around the country a few\nmonths ago. Kings can do whatever they want to, “the public be damned.”\nAmericans have generally supported strong Presidents, but they have\nalways believed that there are limits to executive authority.\n\nWe now seem to be in a time when the President can do whatever he wants\nto without congressional authority or legal precedent. In a typical move\nthis past week, Mr. Trump initiated a criminal investigation of the\nChairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, an institution created to be\nindependent from the White House.\n\nYet, likely the most visible exercise of his power has been the whole\nidea of imposing tariffs on imported goods. It was introduced with great\nfanfare without action of any kind from the Congress.\n\nNow, news releases come from the White House taking credit for reducing\nsome of the various tariffs that were imposed. Recently, we were told\nthat there would no longer be a tariff on coffee, furniture, and beef\namong other items. People started squawking about inflation, so the\nWhite House slashed tariffs on a few products,\n\nBut, what a way to run a government! Merchants, traders and consumers\nhave no idea what to expect from one day to the next.\n\nThe deployment of the National Guard seems to be another whimsical\napplication of Presidential power. Now, months later, the Supreme Court,\nin a rare decision, has declared that the President exceeded his\nauthority in randomly sending troops into American cities. Could the\ntide be turning?\n\nThere is a local connection to this whole question, as our own Supreme\nCourt Justice, Robert H. Jackson, wrote the seminal decision in 1952\nlimiting Presidential power in the government’s seizure of the steel\nmills during the Korean War. President Truman wasn’t happy. Jackson was\na Democrat and a friend. But, the issue went beyond friendship–it dealt\nwith the structure of our democracy and the constitutional limits of\nPresidential power.\n\nThere is another matter which is particularly irksome to me. There now\nseems to be no limit on using the White House as a base for making money\nor expanding one’s personal or business fortune. We have seen everything\nfrom meme coins, to crypto businesses, to accepting the gift of a fancy\njumbo jet from a foreign government, to foreign real estate deals–all\ncoming from the Trump White House.\n\nWhatever happened to the emoluments clause in the U.S. Constitution? Are\nthere no limits to using the Oval Office for personal & business\ndealings?\n\nEnough said. I think when the Trump Presidency has passed, the country,\nafter reflection, will move to impose more enforceable limits on the\nexercise of Presidential power.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

That is not the case with electricity.\n\nChina already consumes twice as much electrical energy as the United\nStates and is way ahead of us when it comes to the efficiency and\ncapacity of their electric grid to transport energy, including renewable\nenergy, across their country.\n\nThe most efficient way of transporting electricity anywhere is with high\nvoltage electric lines. The higher the voltage, the more electricity\nthat can be transported.\n\nIt is hard to build such lines in the United States. People want\nelectricity as long as they aren’t impacted by high tension electric\nlines. Whenever such lines are proposed, environmental and various\nopposition groups unite to try to stop their construction.\n\nMany years ago (the 1980’s) I served as a Trustee of the New York Power\nAuthority. The Authority, at that time, had constructed a high voltage\n765 kilovolt (KV) transmission line from the Canadian border to the\nUtica, NY area to bring in renewable hydro electricity from Quebec.\n\nThe only way we were able to continue that line to the New York City\narea was to agree to reduce the voltage to 345 KV and build two parallel\nlines of towers and wire from Utica down to Westchester County.\n\nChina has no such restrictions when it comes to building transmission\nlines. It is a dictatorship, and the government can do pretty much what\nit wants to.\n\nWe now have in the United States a total of about 2,000 miles of high\nvoltage lines. In China, they have a total of 22 ultrahigh voltage lines\n(1,000 KV,) and one of them, by itself, is 2,000 miles long and runs\nmost of the way across China.\n\nChina outproduces us with renewable electrical energy, but it also\nproduces immense amounts of electricity with its coal-fired power\nplants. China uses more coal than the rest of the world combined. Its\ngreenhouse gas emissions are greater than the United States and European\nUnion combined.\n\nYet, when it comes to electrification itself, the driving energy\nresource of the future…the Chinese are light years ahead of us.\n\nThis also means, of course, that they are able to manufacture goods and\nproducts for export at costs greatly lower than we can in this country.\n\nAnd, that brings us to tariffs. We can try to squeeze more from the\nChinese by imposing tariffs on them, costs which are ultimately paid by\nthe American consumer. But, that doesn’t address the deficiencies of our\nown energy system when it comes to manufacturing and the cost of\nproducing goods here.\n\nOne of our biggest deficiencies is our lack of efficient electrical\ntransmission lines in this country. The electrical system in the United\nStates has been built on a state-by-state, lower voltage model. What we\nneed is a national electrical transmission system–like our Interstate\nHighway system.\n\nWill we ever get there? Not, it seems, in the near future. In the\nmeantime, the Chinese will keep “eating our lunch” when it comes to the\nefficiency of their electrical infrastructure as compared to ours.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n For Old Times’ Sake\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nJan 3, 2026\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nAn old friend of mine, pretty much of the same vintage, sent me an email\nsuggesting that the words of Auld Lang Syne (roughly translated as\nmeaning “for old times’ sake”) might be an appropriate topic for a\ncolumn at New Year’s.\n\nI will give it a try.\n\nMost of the research I have done attributes the song to the Scottish\npoet, Robert Burns in 1788. There were other similar songs written prior\nto that, but he made it famous.\n\nThe other person who made it famous was Guy Lombardo and his band, the\nRoyal Canadians, who started playing it on New Year’s Eve in this\ncountry in 1929. Now, every New Years Eve, as the ball drops to the\nbottom in Times Square, we hear it blared across the world.\n\nThe setting for the song though is not Times Square–it is a pub\nsomewhere in Scotland where two old friends are drinking and talking in\nScottish brogue about the past and periodically raising a toast to\nremember things “for old times’ sake.”\n\nAnd, truly, when you get to be my age, that is what you do on New Year’s\nEve–you remember past friendships, good times and bad, and say a word of\ngratitude that you have experienced it all.\n\nWhat will happen in the upcoming New Year is the focus of the new\ngeneration. They now have to forge ahead and live their lives as we did.\nWe wish them well, and hope that their lives will be as rewarding and\nmemorable as our own.\n\nBurns describes those two old Scots sitting in that pub in Scotland as\nbeing very “Scottish”–“you’ll buy your cup and I’ll buy mine”–no freebie\nthere. But, it will still be a “cup o’kindness.” No hard feelings, only\ngood memories.\n\nThey’ve left nothing on the field: “We two have run about the slopes,\nand picked the daisies fine. But we’ve wandered many a weary foot, since\nauld lang syne.”\n\nThey have worked together but are still each his own: “We two have\npaddled in the stream, from morning sun till dine. But seas between us\nbroad have roared, since auld lang syne.”\n\nAnd, at the end of the day, they remain good friends: “And there’s a\nhand my trusty friend! And give me a hand o’thine! And we’ll take a\nright good-will, for auld lang syne.”\n\nWhat more can be said? Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote that the “old order\nchangeth, yielding place to new.”\n\nWhen you are our age, on New Year’s Eve, you don’t think about the\nnew–you remember and celebrate the old. “Should old acquaintance be\nforgot?” Absolutely not! Remember and celebrate it!\n\nAnother good friend of mine, now deceased, once summarized things when\nlooking back on life with these words: “Thank the Lord for the ships you\ngot on, not the ones you missed.”\n\nThat is also good advice, and so for old times’ sake–have a Happy New\nYear!",

It may\nhave happened once or twice before, but then, I think, it was only\npartially frozen.\n\nThe snowfall this year has also been significant, i.e. the kind of snow\nyou usually see in January or February. At last count, the Village of\nMayville had recorded 58.9 inches of snow.\n\nWe have already seen, in December, a few ice fishermen on the lake–a\nscene that usually takes place in mid to late January. Winter is upon\nus!\n\nThe other day an eagle landed out on the ice apparently to pick up some\nfrozen food or fish it had spotted. Our dogs, who came during past\nChristmastimes and were appropriately named by our grandchildren, were\noutside to do their business and to stretch their legs, then saw the\neagle on the ice and took off.\n\nMy wife screamed, “Come back home, Blitzen!” “Come home, Dasher!” To no\navail. The eagle, of course, cooly ignored the dogs until they got\nclose, and then spread its wings and was gone–the frozen lake displaying\nthe scene in all its glory.\n\nThe dogs got to the spot, looked up at the departing eagle and looked\nback dejectedly toward the house. Finally, the words “Come home… treat!”\ngot through to them. They turned, ambled and finally loped back toward\nthe house. Dogs understand the word “treat,” and that day was no\nexception.\n\nWhen I see the cold and winter and ice descend so early on the lake, I\nbegin reciting in my brain that old Robert Service poem: “‘Twas\nChristmas day and we were mushing our way over the Dawson Trail. Talk of\nyour cold, through the parka’s fold, it stabbed like a driven nail….”\n\nIt has been that kind of winter so far. Robert Service finally takes you\nto “the marge of Lake LaBarge” where he cremates Sam McGee by building a\nfire from the remains of an old derelict Yukon steamboat. Instead, for\nheat, I turn up our natural gas stove to get warm and then gaze out on\nfrozen Lake Chautauqua, grateful that I am inside the house looking out.\n\nJust before ice covered the lake, the migrating white tundra swans came\nthrough. I don’t know how they knew that winter was a month early, but\nhere they were. The ice, as it transitions, builds from the shore toward\nthe middle of the lake, and the swans hung out at the perimeter where\nthe ice and open water met.\n\nAs we know, Chautauqua Lake is now rimmed with hundreds of homes and\ncottages. Yet, at this time of year, these human structures seem to fade\ninto the background along with the snow that surrounds them. The ice and\nsnow-covered lake predominate. When the wind whips up and the snow is\nblowing down the frozen lake, you almost feel like you are out on the\ntundra along with that poet from the Yukon mushing down the Dawson Trail\non that sleigh on Christmas Day.\n\nChautauqua Lake is quite a place. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the\nhumanoids with their activities dominate the lake. Then fall comes and\nthe lake begins to return again to mother nature.\n\nThen comes Christmas, and this year with early ice cover, it makes you\nthink that you actually are up in the far north. It is just you, the\nsnow-covered ice and the elements.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

It was a part of my\nupbringing. It was taught to me by my parents and reinforced by\nteachings from the Bible– “By their deeds you shall know them.”\n\nAs kids we also soon learned that there are usually more “talkers” in\nthe world than there are “doers.” People are to be judged more by what\nthey do than by what they say.\n\nThis translates, of course, into observing the actions vs. the words\nbeing daily issued by our President. He is always tweeting or saying\nthings to get people stirred up, but he is also doing things that we\nneed to observe.\n\nFor example, in the recent campaign for Mayor of the City of New York,\nPresident Trump called Mr. Mamdani a “communist” who would be a threat\nto civilization if elected. After the election, when Mamdani went to the\nWhite House, the President shifted instead toward schmoozing the\nMayor-elect.\n\nThat action said a lot to me. It looks like the Trump administration\nwill try to work with the new Mayor… which is a good thing. It also\nreminds us, that the President is also a New Yorker, has significant\ninvestments in the City and would likely prefer to get along with the\nMayor of New York than continually be fighting with him.\n\nAnother recent action of our President is also of note–his pursuit of\nour largest trading partner led by the biggest communist leader in the\nworld–President Xi of China. Mr. Trump recently traveled about 7,000\nmiles to meet Xi in South Korea. (It was a short trip for Mr. Xi, as\nthat country is right next door to China.)\n\nNow, we are told that President Trump will fly to China in April to meet\nagain with Xi. All of the talk and threats about tariffs have not\nbrought the Chinese leader to the United States. We will first meet with\nhim on his turf. These two actions speak volumes about who is in the\ndriver’s seat when it comes to trade and commerce between our two\ncountries. “Actions speak louder than words.”\n\nSometimes words align with action. For example, with the War in Ukraine\n(probably more accurately described as the “War against Ukraine,”) the\nPresident has been quite consistent in word and deed in putting more\npressure on Zelensky than on Putin to end the war. He has publicly\nadmonished the President of Ukraine yet seems to defer to the Russian\nleader who wants things all his way.\n\nIn terms of the federal government in Washington, the President’s words\nhave pretty much been followed by action–Musk’s chainsaw firings, a\nvaccine denier running the Health Department, a FOX News commentator in\ncharge of the Defense Department… these were things that the President\npromised and has delivered on.\n\nThe one Department that hasn’t changed much in the nation’s capital is\nthe Treasury Department. Here he has appointed a seasoned Wall Street\nbanker as Secretary. The President grew up around Wall Street and, to\nhis credit, has not appointed a fringe character to run the nation’s\neconomy.\n\nThere is so much bluster, talk and media spin that comes from this White\nHouse, that it is sometimes better to just step back and observe.\nActions have always spoken louder than words, and that is still the\ncase.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

I didn’t think much about it when I\nbegan to ask “Siri” to dial a phone number or asked “Alexa” to play\nJohnny Cash on the radio. But, the development of voice recognition\ntechnology should have alerted me to the fact that AI was coming.\n\nNow, you can ask your computer or smart phone almost anything and it\nwill get back to you in a matter of seconds. “I found this on the\ninternet etc.,” giving you at least a preliminary answer to your\nquestion.\n\nIf you want to get into real detail, you can get into a “chat box” which\nwill do in seconds what days and weeks of library research used to do.\n\nThis can be good…for example, in helping a physician diagnose a\nparticularly rare form of disease or for an engineer looking to resolve\na faulty design issue.\n\nBut, we must also remember that AI, like all technologies, has no moral\ncompass. It can be a force for good, or it can be used to enable\ncriminal activity, promote pornography, or advance any manner of\nvenalities that we as humans are known to pursue. It will likely be\nthese misuses and abuses which will eventually lead to AI’s regulation\nin one form or another.\n\nThere is another aspect to AI which human society must also confront,\nand that is its demand for huge amounts of electricity. AI requires that\nlarge computer farms or warehouses be constructed stacked full of\ninterconnected computers. These data centers are high tech, don’t employ\na lot of people, make a lot of noise, require extensive cooling/air\nconditioning and are energy hogs.\n\nBig data centers being designed now can consume a gigawatt of energy –\nthat is about the same as the electrical load in the City of\nPhiladelphia. The CEO of Google has said that the United States will\nneed about 92 of these to meet expected AI demand. That means 92 new\n“Philadelphia’s” will be tapping into the grid.\n\nThe electric grid that we now have is already way behind China, and\nelectricity consumers are gagging on their large electric bills as\nelectric utility companies spend money to try to expand the grid.\n\nHow all of this will pan out, we don’t know. What we do know is that big\nmoney is now chasing AI. What we are now seeing reminds me a bit off the\nold “dot-com” boom of a couple of decades ago when money was chasing\nthat particular new-tech innovation – and a lot of it finally went bust.\n\nI am probably getting out-of-my-league in trying to explain the\ntechnicalities of AI This is something that my kids understand much\nbetter than I do… but, my “ear is to the rails,” and I can hear a big\ntrain coming down the tracks – a new monstrous, expensive reality called\nArtificial Intelligence!",

Many around here\nwill likely spend some time at deer camp that day. In reflecting back,\nthough I have no historical proof of it, I have always thought that the\npilgrims likely ate venison along with turkey on that first Thanksgiving\nDay.\n\nLooking forward to deer season, I guess, is part of my DNA. I was once\nChairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and Wildlife in the State Assembly.\nEvery year we would have discussions with the DEC Division of Fish and\nWildlife about setting the fish and wildlife seasons in New York,\nincluding the big game season.\n\nIn full disclosure, you should also know that I have a Lifetime\nSportsman License (which I purchased some years ago) to hunt and fish in\nthe State of New York. I used to be at deer camp every year on opening\nday. Mobility issues and age have changed that, but I still have great\nmemories of those days.\n\nThough many may not realize it, we need a deer season. The size of the\ndeer herd needs to be balanced with the resources available to support\nits population. This is why there are various deer management units\naround the state. The New York State DEC issues additional permits to\ntake antlerless deer (also called doe permits) depending on the size of\nthe deer herd in those areas.\n\nUrban dwellers are now feeling the effects of what happens when there\nare too many deer. Just ask residents of Jamestown or Lakewood. Deer are\nnot dumb. They go where the eating is good and where they will not be\nbothered by hunters.\n\nIf we lived in a nonhuman environment, mother nature would maintain a\nbalance in the deer population–predators like wolves and coyotes\ncombined with disease and the weather would naturally contain and limit\nthe size of the deer herd.`\n\nSince we don’t live in such a pristine environment anymore, it is up to\nwe humans to help balance the deer population–that is why we have a deer\nseason and regulations governing the harvesting of deer.\n\nEven if you don’t like guns, you will have to admit that it better that\ndeer be taken and used for food rather than seeing them hit by a car and\nlaying alongside the road.\n\nDeer hunters are a special breed. They understand all of this and are\nsome of the most protective conservationists I have ever met. To them,\nthe woods and the deer are sacrosanct.\n\nOften, I will ask them: “Did you get a deer yet?” And, the answer will\nbe: “Well, I saw a couple, but I am waiting for the big one.” What they\nare really saying is that they love being in the woods and are taking\ntheir time because they want to stay there as long as they can.\n\nI can remember the days when the deer population around here was very\nlow. I also remember when there were no turkey to be found, but the\npheasant hunting was good. Times and the wildlife environment have\nchanged. Now, there too many deer, and turkey, not pheasants, abound.\n\nIt is our common obligation to keep the wildlife populations in balance.\nTo my ears, gunshots in the woods this time of year mean not only that\nThanksgiving is here and deer season has started, but, also, that winter\nis right around the corner.\n\nHaving a hunting season for deer is a good thing. Happy Thanksgiving to\nall!Top of Form",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n-  \n\nThe Changing Face Of Warfare\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nNov 22, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nSadly, new technologies are often tested first in warfare, on the\nbattlefield–not in commerce or for civilian use.\n\nFor example, a new technology made its debut in World War I–the\nairplane. Initially thought of as a remarkable new invention to\ntransport people and goods at speeds and distances never imagined–it\nbecame an effective intelligence gathering and killing tool over the\ntrenches and battlefields of France.\n\nI suppose that if you go way back, to prehistoric times, the same kind\nof thing happened. The spear was probably invented to protect\nsettlements from predators and to kill animals for food. Of course, it\nalso became a preferred instrument in warfare–in the killing of fellow\nhuman beings.\n\nNow, in the War in Ukraine, and in other places, we see the development\nof the drone in warfare. When we first heard about drones, they were\ngoing to be the new answer to faster delivery of packages. Drones,\ninstead of deliverymen, would come swooping down your driveway and\nprovide next-day service when you ordered a product online.\n\nInstead, their most effective use to date has been the very efficient\nway in which they can carry on warfare without subjecting a pilot in a\ncockpit to being shot down. The Ukrainians and Russians have been the\nlaboratory in developing these new instruments of war. On one daring\nraid, drones from Ukraine were carried by a truck which had been\nsecretly driven deep into Russia. The drones were released and were able\nto destroy Russian planes on the ground some 800 miles from the\nbattlefield itself.\n\nI look upon all of this through two different lenses–one, as a citizen\nof earth opposed in principle to the idea of war. The second, as a\nveteran of the Vietnam War and former Naval Officer– knowing that we\nmust be prepared for war and for what it brings.\n\nAs to the first, it is sad that new technology always has a war-making\ncomponent. Yet, history seems to prove that to be true.\n\nAs to being a veteran and former member of the U.S. military–one has to\nrealize that the drone has likely changed the way we will conduct\nmilitary operations in the future. I would think, for example, that\nperhaps aircraft carriers may now become drone carriers. Why expose\npilots when a drone can do the work?\n\nDrones may even change the mission of submarines. Perhaps, instead of\ncarrying missiles or torpedoes, submarines will now be built to unleash\ndrones on enemy targets. Because of their stealth, submarines are a\npotent weapon. Now, they will have one more weapon in their arsenal.\n\nThis whole discussion is probably a “downer” and something that people\ndon’t want to think about. Yet, we also can’t hide our heads in the\nsand.\n\nDrones are here to stay and, unfortunately, as long as humans go to war\nagainst each other, they will be an instrument of war.\n\nRolland Kidder is Stow resident",

The Mayor\nof the City of New York receives an annual salary of $258,000, with an\noption of living in a government-owned house at Gracie Mansion. The CEO\nof Tesla lives in a personally owned, gated compound in Austin, Texas,\nreceives millions in compensation and will be compensated with an\nadditional $1 Trillion Dollar bonus if he can meet some aggressive\ngrowth targets for his company.\n\nOn the basis of raw experience, I think you have to give Elon Musk the\nedge. He has proven himself to be an effective CEO in Corporate America.\nHe runs multiple companies and Tesla Corporation is now valued at more\nthan Ford, GM and Chrysler combined.\n\nThe most telling criticism of Mamdani has been about his youth and lack\nof experience. As he, I was a member of the New York State Assembly and\ncan attest that it is not typically a proven training ground for\ncorporate executives or, for that matter, in leading a city of 8 million\npeople.\n\nBut, on the matter of understanding people and politics, despite being\nyoung, you have to give the edge to Mamdani. He understood the\nelectorate’s desire for affordable living, whereas Musk failed to\nrealize that for many Americans, the institutions that he was destroying\nin Washington were important to them.\n\nIt was obvious that the citizens of New York did not buy the argument of\nPresident Trump that Mamdani was a “communist.” Most New Yorkers who\nhave been around as long as Trump has, know that Democrats in the City\nof New York have always been at odds: reformers vs. regulars, liberals\nvs. moderates. The so-called Democratic Socialists are the new\nreform/liberal wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nAs to who will succeed more–Mamdani or Musk–only time will tell. But, I\nthink the challenge will be greatest for Mamdani. Many of his promises\nas to free busing or lower rents…are issues that will require the\nacquiescence of others, either in Albany or perhaps even from\nWashington.\n\nYet, it is clear that Mamdani has won the political contest with Musk.\nHe got 2 million people to vote for him. Though spending millions, Musk\ncould not muster enough support to beat a Democratic state judge in\nWisconsin, and he eventually became so politically toxic for the\nRepublicans that he was quietly eased out of Washington.\n\nI would think that, going forward, the odds makers in Las Vegas will\ngive the political/governmental edge to Mamdani. The capitalist/business\nedge will stay with Musk. Diversity in America is alive and well !\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

This morning one of the\nweather prediction sites said that we could have “intermittent snow”\nnext week.\n\nI have never been a big winter guy. I think I would be happiest if we\nhad continual rotations of spring and fall – but such is not the case.\nWinter is a reality, especially around here.\n\nA good friend calls me about this time every year to discuss the\nshortness of days. We both get a little down as the daylight hours get\nshorter and the nights become longer. But, she is an optimist, and I am\nmore of a pessimist.\n\n“Just think,” she says, “next month we will have the shortest day of the\nyear, and then the days will start getting longer!”\n\nTo which I retort: “Don’t forget, that day is also the beginning of\nwinter, and then we have the cold of January and February after that!”\n\nOf course, we are both right – but she sees the upside more than I do.\n\nAnother harbinger of the coming winter is the insufferable change from\ndaylight savings time to standard time. I like the fact that the sky is\nlighter in the morning now but then I have to remind myself that the sun\nis setting earlier in the afternoon – a bummer!\n\nInterestingly, our dogs have a hard time when the time change comes.\nThey are used to having their evening meal at about 5:30 p.m. After the\nchange to standard time, they started whining for food at about 4:30\np.m. Where is it? Did you forget to feed us?\n\nWe have tried to explain it to them…but to no avail. We finally cave in\nand split the difference. They will now be fed at 5 p.m. Eastern\nStandard Time.\n\nBut, again, the time change means that winter is coming, even for the\ndogs. They will, of course, love it. There is nothing like a couple of\ndogs playing in the snow.\n\nAnd, the snow, the beloved snow. It will soon be here. Lake Erie is\nstill warm and that means that the first cold air coming over it will\npick up a lot of moisture which will miraculously turn to snow when it\nsweeps over the cold ground.\n\nUsually, this means that the north-county, along the lake, will get\nhammered by the first snow falls…so standby Dunkirk, Fredonia, and\nWestfield – it is coming!\n\nThen, slowly, the big snow falls will move into the hills where we live.\nThe rising winds will wait to release their snow on the rest of us.\n\nSo, get your galoshes out, your hats and mittens ready. This is\nChautauqua County. If you think you can avoid winter around here, you\nhave another thing coming. Winter around here really means “winter.”\n\nSince we can’t avoid it, we might as well enjoy it!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

And, so it appeared in the early\ndays of the Trump administration.\n\nThere was Elon Musk jumping around onstage with his chainsaw empowered\nwith the ability to cut and slash government spending through a new\nmechanism called DOGE–Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe first agency to go was the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID.) Supported in the past by both Republican and\nDemocratic administrations, it was deemed to be unworthy of any more\ngovernment spending, though no replacement was announced to address\nfamine, pandemics or natural disasters when they occur around the world.\n\n“Good riddance…USAID is gone!” Its signs were removed from federal\nbuildings. The new administration believed in less government.\n\nThen came the emails to federal employees, requiring them to justify\ntheir jobs or be fired. If you worked for the federal government, you\nwere deemed to be expendable.\n\n“Finally,” the true believers thought, “we have an administration that\nis really going to cut (and gut) the federal government!”\n\nYet, at the same time, moves were being made to increase the power and\nreach of that same government. In a time of high employment, a\nPresidential decree came out that said we must protect American jobs\nwith tariffs. An “emergency” was declared, though it is not clear what\nit was.\n\nWithout Congressional authorization, tariffs were imposed ranging from\n10% to 80% depending on the acquiescence and submissiveness of the\nforeign government involved. Our friend, Canada, was whacked with up to\n50% tariffs, and now another 10% has been added because Ontario ran a\npro-Canadian TV ad quoting former President Reagan’s opposition to\ntariffs.\n\nThen came a $9 billion dollar federal investment in a private\ncorporation–Intel. The last big bailout of the auto companies took\nCongressional action, but there was no talk this time about needing to\nhave Congress involved.\n\nThen there was the $20 billion purchase of Argentine pesos to help\nbailout Buenos Aires. Who authorized that?\n\nOr what about the tearing down of the East Wing of the White House to\nbuild a new ballroom? Where was Congress on that one?…they were out of\ntown, essentially on vacation, waiting for Speaker Johnson to call them\nback. At last count though, they were still receiving their paychecks.\n\nWe are told not to worry about paying our troops during the budget\nshutdown because an Andrew Mellon heir will purportedly take care of\nthat, and Qatar gifted a fancy new airplane for the White House…no\nproblem there. Even the new White House Ballroom, it is said, will be\nfinanced by some, as yet, unannounced, wealthy billionaire.\n\nAnd, just think of the poor National Guardsmen who thought they had\nsigned up as “weekend warriors.” Now, they may be coming for an\nindefinite period to police a city near you… as of now, taxpayers are on\nthe hook for that.\n\nAh, and to think we were about to enter an era of smaller government.\n\nSit back and relax. In this administration, “best” means “biggest.”\nEverything is now the biggest it has ever been (including the deficit,)\nand the long arm of the federal government is bigger than ever.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

If I were in his\ninner circle, I would advise him that this is an honor for which you are\nchosen–not one you lobby or campaign for.\n\nBut, that aside, if he can pull off a solution to the current\nIsraeli/Gazan War, perhaps he should be so honored.\n\nAs the columnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote: “If Donald Trump is\nable to secure a cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, return of\nIsraeli hostages, and it holds and paves the way for negotiations on the\nonly solution of two states for two people…Trump will not only deserve\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, he’ll deserve the Nobel Prize in Physics and\nChemistry as well. Because that would be quite an achievement.”\n\nI have not been a fan of Donald Trump’s top-down approach to governing\nnor of many of his policies — but, I too am hoping that he can find a\nway out of this terrible war in which Hamas killed some 2,000 Israelis,\nand where Israel has killed some 60,000 Palestinians in response.\n\nPresident Trump is in a unique position to end this conflict. First, and\nforemost, in being as close as he is to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s\nleader, Trump essentially coopted him, pushing Netanyahu into accepting\na ceasefire and bringing the war to an end.\n\nTrump also has deep roots and connections to the Arab countries of the\nMiddle East, not just as President but through his family and business\nconnections with countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These nations\nmet in Egypt with the United States and hammered out a deal to end the\nIsraeli-Gazan War. Great Britain and France were also supporting the\neffort. It was not just the United States that was involved.\n\nAny resolution from the carnage of Gaza to Israel’s exhaustion and\ndiminishment resulting from this war, will require support from Arab\nnations in the region. Meetings are continuing in Egypt with several\ncountries now involved including representatives from the United\nNations.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I give you credit for getting the parties to the\ntable, and, as an American, I am hoping that your efforts can lead to a\npermanent peace in the area.\n\nMy only advice would be that you keep after the effort. It will take\ntime. This is no “slam-dunk,” quick-and-its-over situation. The\ndivisions and hatreds in this part of the world run deep, so whatever\nsolution is arrived at must have staying power and will require a\nlong-term commitment. Wars are easy to start, but difficult to end.\n\nFriedman addressed this same issue with a question: “Will the Trump\nadministration have the attention, the energy and the focus that’ll be\nrequired every day to keep such a complicated solution on track?” “I\nhope so,” he concludes.\n\nI hope so too. If President Trump can stop this war, keep it stopped,\nstart a new and responsible governance for Palestine, and keep Israel\nwithin its borders…maybe he will be recognized for his work by the Nobel\nCommittees in Norway and Sweden.\n\nIt may seem unlikely that a President who has created a Department of\nWar instead of Defense would receive a Peace Prize, but stranger things\nhave been known to have happened down through the course of human\nhistory.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

You are also becoming aware that you\nwon’t live forever, and having things more simple in your life is good,\nnot only for you, but for your family, for your friends and for those\naround you.\n\nSome of this is also health driven. Your body and back just don’t want\nto do as much work as they used to. Cleaning the floors, shoveling the\nwalk, moving furniture around–all of the things you never thought once\nabout doing–now become more of a hassle. It is time to think about\ndownsizing.\n\nFriends of ours recently sold their house and moved into an apartment.\nOther friends sold a home that they had loved and had hosted innumerable\nparties and get-togethers in…and bought a smaller house, all on one\nfloor with a drive-in garage. In addition, they share the cost of mutual\ntasks like snow removal, lawn mowing and driveway maintenance with\nothers in the same development. It simplifies things.\n\nYet, it isn’t easy to move. There are a lot of memories tied up after\nyou spend many years in the same house.\n\nThere are many other reasons why downsizing is difficult. It is an\nadmission of the fact that you are getting older, it usually requires a\nchange in residence which is difficult under any circumstance, and if\noften means that you are not going to be as much in the center of the\n“social swirl” in your life…that is being passed down to the younger\ngeneration.\n\nYet, an upside to downsizing, in my view, is that it reminds you of the\nimportance of family and friends. Often, folks of my age will move to be\ncloser to friends and family–and that is a good thing.\n\nIt is also important to remember that downsizing is not bad or some kind\nof anomaly in life. It is a part of the normal thought and\ndecision-making process that comes with aging. It is better to embrace\nit than to fight it.\n\nOne final thought about the subject. Timing can be important. It is\nbetter to deal with downsizing while you still have the capability of\ndoing so. If you wait too long, others may be “saddled” with having to\nmake that decision for you. Making and implementing decisions while you\ncan is a good thing.\n\nWhat Alfred Lord Tennyson wrote is true: “The old order changeth,\nyielding place to new….”\n\nWelcome to the world of downsizing!",

Yet, somehow, we lost our “mojo.”\nAlong came the fall of China to the communists and then the war in\nKorea.\n\nSuddenly, in the 1950’s, we were in a mood of fear and apprehension.\nAlong came Senator Joe McCarthy, “pouring kerosene on the fire,” blaming\nit all on purported communists in the government and conducting a\ncampaign of fear, falsehoods and blame.

It took President Eisenhower to steady the ship and then for\nPresident John Kennedy to bring us new hope and new direction in 1960.\n\nA similar pattern developed in the late 1960’s and early ’70’s. The\nheady years of confronting segregation and passing a Civil Rights Act\ndescended into acrimony and blame during the Vietnam War and these\nfeelings were exacerbated by riots which were erupting in the cities.\nThis negative mood followed Richard Nixon into office. It took President\nCarter to “steady the ship,” and then President Reagan to instill a\nrenewed sense of confidence and pride again in our national politics.\n\nNow, again, we are in national funk which seems at least partly related\nto our misguided wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fear and blame are\nrampant. It is the “radical” right against the “lunatic” left. There\nseems to be no middle ground which is where Americans like to be.\nSeemingly, someone has to always be blamed when things go wrong.\n\nSadly, I don’t see things much changing with the current administration.\nWe have a President who, right off the bat, blamed the “lunatic left”\nfor the Charlie Kirk assassination. Someone, apparently, had to be\nblamed, though, at the time, little was known about the assassin.\n\nNow that Kirk’s assassin has been apprehended, early reports indicate\nthat he was not affiliated with any political party, may have been\nradicalized by the violence promoted through the internet and video\ngames, was a loner and–like most assassins–he may have mental or\nemotional issues influencing his behavior. Whatever his motivations, it\nwas a terrible crime.\n\nYet, it was not a time to fan the flames of hatred through\nfinger-pointing and blame. Sometimes our Commander-in-Chief needs to be\nour “Healer-in-Chief.” I thought that the Governor of Utah provided\nbetter leadership by calling for national mourning and an end to\npartisan blame-calling. The country needs voices of unity and healing\nafter such horrific incidents.\n\nSo, what is next?\n\nIf the cycles of our political life are any indication, a leader will\nbecome President who will help stabilize and reunify the country. Then\nthat person, or another, will bring us again to remembering the American\nspirit and how we have jointly and positively addressed the issues that\nwe have faced in past years.\n\nIn the end, our national motto “E Pluribus Unum” (out of many one,) will\nwork once more and Americans will come together in unity to tackle the\nnext big problem (or problems) that will inevitably come along.\n\nThis is our common hope and is what keeps us going as a country.\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form",

But, perhaps, the best headline of the whole year in\ncompetitive, professional golf came out of that final match.\n\nA journey-man golfer, a guy who had tried 163 times to win a golf\ntournament but without success…would finally win one, and it would be\nfor the whole “shebang,”\n\nTommy Fleetwood, who had probably come in second on more golf\ntournaments than any other player currently playing, would win the big\none–the one with the most money and a lot of prestige, the FEDEX Cup.\n\nWhen you watch Tommy Fleetwood play, you would say that he is a bit “out\nof his league.” He is shorter and slighter than most players. He has\nlong hair and looks a bit like one of the old “hippies” from the ’60’s.\n\nYet, Fleetwood has a quality which is probably more important than any\nother in the world of sport–he is persistent. He wouldn’t take “No” for\nan answer. He kept coming back again and again and after 163 starts as a\nprofessional golfer–he finally won.\n\nThere is a big lesson here. Remember the old saying: “If at once you\ndon’t succeed, try, try again!” There is real truth in it.\n\nMost people who have a skill or a passion are like Tommy Fleetwood. They\nare good, they love what they do. Yet, life is not a straight line. We\ncan hit roadblocks, have a bad day, or just be out-competed.\n\nBut, this is where perseverance comes in. Many will give up and say:\n“Well, I guess it is not meant to be.” And, they will shift their\ninterest to other things.\n\nThen, there are people like Tommy Fleetwood who say: “I know I can do\nit. I am going to stay with it until I win!”\n\nIt reminds me a bit of a children’s book that my mother used to read to\nus as kids about the “little engine that could.” It was about an engine\npulling a train and going up a hill. It kept chugging slowly along\nsaying: “I think I can, I think I can, I think I can.”\n\nThen it finally got over the top of the hill, and coming down the other\nside in a faster cadence the chugging changed to: “I know I can, I know\nI can, I know I can!”\n\nThere is something to be said for perseverance.

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n War Department Not A Good Idea\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nSep 13, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder\n\n  \n\nOur President announced recently that we should rename the Defense\nDepartment, the “War\n\nDepartment” because we have not been winning enough wars. That is a bad\nidea.\n\nMaybe it was an idea that came from some of the “issue for the day”\npeople that he has surrounded himself with, i.e. it didn’t originate\nfrom him. But, still, war is not something that we should be embracing,\npromoting or touting in any manner.\n\nCongress and the courts should just let the Defense Department remain\nthe “Defense” Department. Let the President sign all of the Executive\nOrders that he wants to…but let’s not go back to the “War” Department.\n\nI have often thought, though it may be just happenstance, that Robert H.\nJackson may have influenced the renaming of the old War Department as\nthe new “Defense Department” back in 1947. Remember, he had just gone\nthrough the major trial of Nazi defendants at Nuremberg.\n\nOne of Jackson’s observations coming out of that experience is engraved\non the flagpole base at the Robert Jackson Center here in town. It says:\n“If we can root out of men’s thinking that all wars are legal… at last\nwe will have mobilized the forces of law on the side of peace.”\n\nThe last thing we need to do to promote peace in the world is to go back\nto the idea that war is inevitable and legitimate. Yes, we do have a\nright to defend ourselves as a nation…but that gives us no right to\nframe “war” as an objective by giving it the priority of departmental\nstatus in our government.\n\nAdmittedly, the name change to Defense Department came out of a\nlong-needed reorganization of our military services… an evaluation\nsparked in many ways by our experience in the Second World War. There\nhad been serious divisions during that conflict between the Army and the\nNavy, and there was also a perceived need to create the Air Force as a\nseparate service. Better coordination was needed. That reorganization\nalso gave impetus to creating a department of “defense” and not “war.”\n\nIn the United States, a strong defense has always been framed as a way\nto avoid war, not to promote it.\n\nI know something about war, having actually been in one and in combat.\nIt is not something anyone should want.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I am assuming that the idea of creating a War\nDepartment was not a serious proposal, but just something to get people\nlike me riled up. I know that you had a falling out with both General\n“Mad Dog” Mattis and General Kelly in your first administration, both of\nwhom had distinguished careers in the Marine Corps. But on something as\nconsequential as renaming the Pentagon as the home of “war” instead of\n“defense,”–perhaps you should pull them back into your orbit one more\ntime and ask them what they might think of such an idea.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a Vietnam veteran.\n\nTop of Form",

Our farm was located on top of a\nhill, and we could see the weather coming from the west and then view it\nto the east as it descended upon Frewsburg and then into the hills\naround Frew Run and Bone Run.\n\nWeather became even more a part of my life when I started flying. When\nyou first start flying a plane, you can only fly when the weather is\ngood…it takes time to earn an instrument ticket so that you can fly in\nclouds and in low visibility.\n\nBack then, we had just the beginnings of weather radar, and so the FAA\nFlight Service Stations across the country would report their weather by\nteletype. You had to learn to read the shorthand symbols that were used,\nbut, by so doing, you could find out the weather at your destination and\nat airports in between. Was it cloudy, windy, what kind of\nprecipitation, was visibility limited, what was the temperature etc.? It\ncould all be deciphered from those teletype messages. You didn’t want to\ntake off and then be unable to land.\n\nToday, of course, many airplanes and virtually all commercial flights\nhave weather radar right in the cockpit. You can request changes with\nFAA flight control while enroute to keep away from bad weather.\n\nTo me it is mesmerizing just to watch the weather radar on my computer.\nYou can dial in your own location or watch what is happening nationally.\nYou can see the storm systems move and get a sense of what the weather\nis, and what it will be, at least for the next day or two.\n\nComputers, of course, have made weather prediction better. We now have\nyears and even decades of data showing how weather has acted or\ndeveloped in the past…and so the weatherman is pretty good at letting\nyou know at least what to expect in the next 24 or 48 hours.\n\nHowever, the further out you go in time…the less predictable the\npredictions are. When my wife tells me what her cell phone is predicting\nfor the weather next week or in two weeks, I take it with a grain of\nsalt.\n\nAnd, sadly, the weather can still change in a moment and do the\nunexpected…as was apparently the case in the recent flash-flooding in\nTexas that claimed so many lives.\n\nWeather has been and still is the giant in the room. During World War\nII, D-Day was delayed because of strong winds, and typhoons sank ships\nin the Pacific. Hurricanes today can destroy coastal communities.\n\nThere are fewer surprises today because of our better understanding of\nthe weather, especially though the use of satellite imagery. But, storms\nand bad weather can still pop-up unexpectedly.\n\nThere is one axiom about the weather which has remained constant over\ntime…you have to respect it. Most aircraft accidents associated with the\nweather are actually accidents caused by pilots who have put their\nairplane in a place where it should not have been. Car and boat\naccidents also happen when people don’t pay attention and drive into\ndangerous conditions.\n\nEnough said. The next time you are bored and don’t know which TV show\nyou want to watch…just go to Accu Weather or a similar site and watch\nthe weather come and go. Watching the weather is interesting. It can be\nquite a show and beats most of what Hollywood produces!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

You had only to\ndrive a few hours north of Toronto before you were in the “bush” as we\ncalled it.\n\nThere is the well-known Algonquin Provincial Park in the Huntsville\narea, but we also paddled rivers north of North Bay…up in the areas\nwhere the roads north end, and the only way to go further north is with\na canoe and a paddle.\n\nWe also liked to canoe rivers with rapids, white water and portages. All\nfood had to be carried in and the water for drinking was the same water\nin which you were paddling. There is nothing like wilderness canoeing to\nget you “back to nature” in a hurry.\n\nAbout 90% of Canadians live south of this, within 200 miles of the U.S.\nborder…but the beauty and immensity of their country north of that is an\narea comparable to that of the American west. It is a wonderful place to\nbe.\n\nWe were always welcome in those areas of North America though we were\nfrom another country. Canadians also have come south, not just to\nEllicottville to ski, but to vacation and spend winter months in\nFlorida.\n\nThe economy of the United States dwarfs that of Canada, but the two\ncountries have always been close, and friendly relations have existed\nalong a 5,000 mile plus border.\n\nNow, things have temporarily “soured.” The Canadians have been told that\nthey should become the 51st state, and that, in the meantime, they are\ngoing to be treated with tariffs and economic pain.\n\nNeedless to say, Canadians are not happy about this. Visits to the\nUnited States from Canada have declined and some have put their\nproperties up for sale in places like Ellicottville and Florida…and I\ncan’t say that I blame them.\n\nJust put the “shoe on the other foot.” How would we like it if Canada\nwere more powerful, and they were telling us what to do? We would feel\nthe same way.\n\nSo, for all of these reasons, I decided to buy a Canadian flag and raise\nit along with the American flag that we fly from our lawn here on the\nlake. The Red Maple Leaf flag is a bit smaller and flies beneath “Old\nGlory,” but there it flies. It seemed to me that it was needed here this\nsummer–not just to assuage any Canadians coming by but to remind us of\nthe neighborliness we have had between our two countries over many\nyears.\n\nAnd, to be honest, I am not really interested in expanding the United\nStates into any other place whether it be Canada, Greenland or the\nPanama Canal. We have enough of our own problems to deal with, and\nworking with other nations has always been a better idea than trying to\ntake them over.",

      "text": "Why Neatness Matters\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nAug 9, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nWhile growing up on the farm, my father always stressed the importance\nof neatness in the way things were done. He didn’t make a lot of money\nin dairy farming, but he also never spared spending when it came to\nkeeping the barn painted, maintaining the farm equipment, or mowing the\nlawn.\n\nTo him spartan living did not mean slovenly living. It was important to\nkeep things cleaned up, and to do the best with what you had.\n\nThat has always stuck with me, and I give a “lot of points” to people\nand organizations who keep things neat and clean.\n\nIn that vein, for example, I was pleased recently to notice that the\nwater tower at the Jamestown Airport had been painted. I had noted a\ncouple of years ago that it looked faded and rusty. So “kudos” go to the\nTown of Ellicott for getting it painted!\n\nIt may sound “nit-picking,” but, in my view, when you are trying to move\nthings ahead at the airport–the visual impact of something as obvious as\na water tower can make a difference.\n\nIn like manner, on the negative side, I always worry when I see an\nunpainted house or an unmowed lawn. There may be extenuating\ncircumstances, but often it means that a property may be in decline…and\nthat is not good.\n\nThis is a generalization, but, in my view, based upon traveling a bit\noverseas–I have found the Germans too be especially tidy in the way that\nthey live. There is no garbage on side of the road, no houses in need of\npaint, no abandoned refrigerators in the backyard. One reason that\nGerman engineering and business have been so successful over the years\nis that they keep things neat and clean.\n\nIt doesn’t mean that we can’t do it in the United States. Some recent\nforeign visitors to New York City have remarked to me on how clean the\nCity now is, and how impressed they were when they visited. They\nexpected, perhaps based upon past reputation, that the opposite would be\ntrue.\n\nI think that this time of year may be the best time to write about such\na subject since everything around here is now pretty much hidden by\ngreen. A more revealing time is during March and April after the snow is\ngone and before the trees bloom.\n\nOn the plus side, it really perks me up when I see that great care and\nnurturing are visible. For example, on Sixth Street in Jamestown, just\nbefore you pass over the Sixth Street bridge heading west, is a\ntwo-story, old, well-kept house. But, what makes it spectacular this\ntime of year is that the lawn, porch and virtually whole front yard is\ncovered with planted flowers. You can’t miss it.\n\nMaybe the owner works in the floral industry. I don’t know. But, the\nmessage being given is clear: “I love this house.” “I love flowers,”\nand–“Please, enjoy the day!”\n\nKeeping things spruced up is a good thing, and something we should laud\nand appreciate. Neatness and taking proper care of things matters.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n The Downside Uncertainty Of Tariffs\n\nAug 2, 2025\n\n Rolland Kidder\n\nThe Trump administration’s levying of tariffs is a form of taxation,\nessentially a tax hidden from public view. They are imposed before the\nfinal sale of a product. In essence, tariffs are a pre-sales tax, levied\nat a port-of-entry on goods coming into the country. They are included\nin the price being paid by Americans for whatever the product is.\n\nSo, for example, let’s say a carpet made in Vietnam comes into the Port\nof New York for ultimate sale here. The cost of the carpet goes up 20%\nwhen the federal government slaps a tariff on it in New York, and then\nit comes here where an additional 8% sales tax is added.\n\nWe know that the 8% added here goes to state and local government. What\nhappens to the 20% going to Washington? We don’t know, though some of it\nis likely going to help pay off our growing national debt.\n\nYet, more devasting than the cost of tariffs, is their negative impact\nbecause of the unpredictability they cause in the market place. The\nPresident seems to raise and lower them at a whim. It is hard to operate\na company with a sound business plan when you are not sure how the\ntariffs are going to affect your business.\n\nThis past week, I drove past the Cummins Engine plant here and saw fewer\ncars in the parking lot than I usually see there. When inquiring with\nsomeone more familiar with their operations, it seems that Cummins\nengine orders are way down from where they were a year ago…so shortened\nwork weeks, partial voluntary time reductions etc. are now underway at\nthe plant.\n\nYou wouldn’t think such a slowdown possible as you still see a lot of\ntrucks on the road. What seems to be happening is that instead of\nreplacing engines as they get old…trucking companies are trying to\nstretch the life of old engines because they are uncertain as to what\nthe economic effects will be of all of the tariffs being imposed.\n\nSuch uncertainty also directly affects an international company such as\nCummins. They sell a lot of engines in Europe and Asia. If we impose\ntariffs on those countries, those countries will reciprocate by raising\ntariffs on our products. That means that our truck engines will become\nmore expensive in those markets…thus, reducing sales.\n\nIn short, the world economy is like a very finely tuned watch–if one\npart of it changes, then there are rippling effects down the line.\nTariffs create uncertainty, and uncertainty is not good for jobs and the\neconomy.\n\nIt has been interesting to watch the leaders of various countries coming\nto pay obeisance to President Trump in the White House. They say good\nthings because they don’t want to be crushed by him with U.S. tariffs.\n\nBut, the country that matters most–China, has not come groveling to the\nWhite House. Instead, the Secretary of the Treasury has been going to\nplaces like Geneva and Stockholm to meet with his counterparts from\nChina about trying to strike a deal on tariffs. The Chinese have never\nliked the idea of “kowtowing”–a Chinese word describing bending the knee\nor bowing the head to a superior power. They are not going to kowtow to\nDonald Trump.\n\nMost industries that we have in America today are affected one way or\nanother by international trade. The economic uncertainty being caused by\ntariffs is having downside, negative effects.",

But, golf is not just an American sport–it is a\nworld sport.\n\nAnd, guess who was in the final pairing on Sunday? Yes, a player by the\nname of Haotong Li, from China. The lesson here was obvious: competitors\ndon’t have to be enemies. The world of sport teaches you that.\n\nIt is true that I don’t like the fact that the Chinese government is run\nby a dictatorship. Yet, I don’t hold that against the Chinese people.\nThey are people just as we are, and they have good athletes. The world\nof sport teaches that.\n\nIn addition, not everything that we have and enjoy was invented in\nAmerica. Golf was “invented,” so-to-speak, in Scotland. The organization\nthat started it, frames the rules that govern it, and sponsors The Open\neach year is named “The Royal and Ancient” (R & A)–and it makes its home\nat the place the sport originated…St. Andrews, Scotland.\n\nThis all gets personal for me, because I have been privileged in my\nlifetime to have played the Old Course at St. Andrews. Also, on one\nterribly rainy and windy day, I tried to play Royal Portrush–where The\nOpen was played this past weekend.\n\nI say “tried” to play, as the playing conditions got so rough that I\ncouldn’t keep the ball in the fairway. I took out a three wood on a\n150-yard par three, hit it as hard as I could into the wind, and put it\nin a gully short of the green. (You can tell that I am not a great\ngolfer.) After that, I picked up my ball and walked the rest of the\ncourse with my friends. I had not played Royal Portrush, it had “played”\nme.\n\nThe favorite at this year’s tournament was Rory McIlroy from Northern\nIreland. He, obviously, didn’t win, but made some meaningful remarks at\nthe end reminding the world that the playing of The Open at Portrush was\nagain possible because the fighting had finally stopped a few years back\nbetween northern and southern Ireland.\n\nThat is another lesson we can learn from sport…it can be a bridge for\n“bridging” our differences.\n\nThen there is the always beautiful ending of The Open, when the\nPresident of the R & A presents the Gold Medal and the Claret Jug to the\n“Golfer of the Year.” The golfer of the year in the U.K. is not the\nperson who won The Masters, the PGA, the US Open or is rated number one\nin the world–it is he who has survived and prevailed over four tough\ndays in all kinds of weather in the oldest international tournament in\ngolf in the land where it started. To the Brits, that defines who the\ngolfer of the year is.\n\nFinally, there was the presentation made to Scottie Sheffler, who,\nstanding next to his wife with his year-old son in his arms, graciously\naccepted the honor. No politics or breast-beating about who was from\nwhat country, but a message that the importance of family trumps\neverything…including nationality and sport itself.\n\nAnd, the fact that Portrush is a small town of about 6,000, and the golf\nclub is a public course – what a story in itself! Sport can teach us a\nlot about the good things of life…as it did in Ireland last weekend.",

When she got home that day, she\nrealized that the walker she brought home from Chautauqua was not the\none she had taken to the lecture.\n\nJust think about it. There are a number of people at Chautauqua who use\nthese devices–and, except for differences in color, they all look pretty\nmuch the same. Result–you can bring one home that may not be the same as\nthe one you took.\n\nAnd, when that happens, a whole series of additional events is\ntriggered. The person now missing their walker, realizing probably what\nhad happened, took a similar-looking walker and started home…hoping that\nsomehow the mistake would be realized, and that things could be\nrectified.\n\nWhen that bereaved owner, missing her own walker, “borrowed” another to\nget home, another person came up and said: “I’m sorry, but that is my\nwalker. Here, you can have this one.” That one was my wife’s and that is\nhow it was eventually returned to her.\n\nHad it made it into the newspaper, the headline would probably have\nbeen: “Missing Rollator Mystifies Chautauqua!”\n\nOf course, the mystery was soon solved. The next day, a posting on\nsocial media was made by the person whose rollator/walker had\ndisappeared. When my wife met her to exchange walkers, it was found that\nthe story had been even more intriguing than thought.\n\nIn short, a three-way exchange was needed in order to finally rectify\nthe mistaken, innocent absconding of similar-looking walkers, all which\nhad been parked near each other behind the amphitheater during the\nlecture.\n\nA simple mistake had become complex–a multiple return and exchange was\nrequired to finally resolve things. And…so it goes as we relearn one of\nthe lessons of life. When things look the same, complex things can\nhappen.\n\nThe whole episode reminded me of similar things happening when we were\nkids in elementary school. Sometimes someone would mistakenly take the\nwrong bike from the bike-rack after school and then ride it home. At\ntimes, the mistaken “exchange” had resulted in a better bike being taken\nthan the one brought to school. Yet, the teachers would ultimately, the\nnext day, get to the bottom of it and everything would be ironed out.\nAll Schwinn bikes looked the same, and such things could happen.\n\nAnd, I still remember the time when someone took my coat (which looked\nlike theirs) from the restaurant coat room, and my car keys were in it.\nWhen they got home, it was discovered. My coat and car keys were\nreturned to the restaurant, and we were eventually able to drive home.\n\nSo, it is not just with transportation devices but in many\nsituations–when things look the same, complex ramifications can occur!\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n The Separation Of Church And State\n\nJul 5, 2025\n\n Rolland Kidder\n\nIt was drilled into me at an early age that part of being an American\nwas the belief in the separation of Church and State.\n\nOf course, the foundation of that belief goes back to the earliest\nhistory of the country when immigrants came here from Europe to escape\nreligious persecution. That principle was codified in the Constitution\nof the United States with the words: “Congress shall make no law\nrespecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise\nthereof….”\n\nHaving said that, it worries me that today some are beginning to equate\nreligious affiliation with political party affiliation. “To be a good\nChristian you need to be a ____.” It doesn’t matter which party you use\nto fill in the blank, it is a bad idea.\n\nOne’s religious beliefs should not become equated with what it means to\nbe an American. Not only is it poor politics, it ends up equating a\nreligious belief with an earthly, temporal, secular point-of-view. From\na theological standpoint, that can be a form of idolatry.\n\nThese are round numbers, but in the 17th century during the Thirty Years\nWar largely between Protestants and Catholics, it has been estimated\nthat approximately 20%-25% of the population of Central Europe was\nkilled. Mixing religion with politics can do that.\n\nIt is no wonder that the founding fathers didn’t want that to happen in\nAmerica.\n\nIf you look around the world today, there is still a lot of war going on\nbased, in large part, upon religion…the most prominent example today\nlikely being between Muslim Gaza and Jewish Israel. Now Israel and Iran\nare involved in a shooting war with our country now also getting\ninvolved. Fueling much of this war-making in the Middle East is\nreligious hatred.\n\nAs an American, I distinguish between Judaism as a religion and Israel\nas a state. In like manner, being a Palestinian or an Iranian is not the\nsame for me as a religious belief in Islam. Religious beliefs should be\nseparate and distinct from the state.\n\nYet, because religion and the state are equated in that part of the\nworld, we are now experiencing war there with a level of ferocity and\ndestruction reminiscent of the Second World War.\n\nPerhaps there is a middle ground when it comes to separating Church and\nState. In Germany, for example, the government supports both Protestant\nand Catholic Churches depending upon which part of the country you live\nin. The general populace accepts that, and Germany goes on about its\nbusiness of continuing to be a thriving democracy in central Europe\nessentially ignoring differences in religion by supporting two main\nbranches of Christianity.\n\nYet, I think the American ideal is a better model to follow…just keep\nthe state and religion separated. Don’t mix them up, or, at least, try\nnot to. That should be our goal.\n\nWe have enough problems with common humanity in the world in trying to\nkeep our cultural/national/racial identities from taking us to war. We\ndon’t need religion to be another source of war-making.",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\nThe Importance Of Esprit De Corps\n\nsJune 14, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nThe importance of “esprit de corps” hit me recently as I was watching\nthe workers on the sewer construction job now being built north of Stow\non the west side of the lake. These French words refer to team spirit,\nto people respecting each other and working together for a common\npurpose.\n\nThe construction workers on this job work as a team without a lot of\nshouting or being “bossed” around. They just do their jobs and expect\nthose around them to do the same. It is obvious that they respect each\nother and like their jobs.\n\nOne may be on a backhoe, another laying out the route of pipe for the\nnext day, another restoring areas disturbed as the new sewer system is\ninstalled–but their effort is quite seamless. It is inspiring to watch.\n\nIn looking back at my own life experience, it made me recall my first\nduty assignment as a new Ensign in the U.S. Navy back in 1967. I was\nassigned to be the Operations Officer on a small ship homebased in\nSasebo, Japan.\n\nIt truly was a small ship by Navy standards…60 men with 6 officers were\nits contingent. In reflection, though, what really made its smallness\nsignificant is that we usually operated alone, not in the company of\nother ships.\n\nOur mission required us to work with other allied Navies in that part of\nthe world, so we would travel to places like South Korea, the\nPhilippines, Vietnam, etc. to do our work…and we would travel alone.\n\nWe didn’t think much about it then, but the fact that we could travel\nsuch long distances without significant help close by was a testament to\nthe commitment of members of the crew to each other and to our\ndependence upon each other. People knew their jobs, respected each\nother, and trusted in one another.\n\nHere I was…a greenhorn, boot Ensign right out of Officer Candidate\nSchool and while underway was assigned as an Officer of the Deck on the\nbridge responsible for the safety and movements of the ship for four\nhours at a time, often in the middle of the night. But, it wasn’t just\nme up there on the bridge, there was a duty section consisting of one\nthird of the crew up and working at the same time all over the ship\ndoing their jobs. We were a team. There was an “esprit de corps” in what\nwe were doing.\n\nI remember one time on that ship when we were caught in what were close\nto typhoon-force winds while enroute from Taiwan back to our homebase in\nJapan. The seas were so high that they had the power to roll the ship\nover. We had to keep the bow of the ship into the oncoming waves to\navoid this.\n\nThe bridge was about 25 ft. above the waterline, and the waves were\nabout 30 ft. in height. Sometimes, for a second or two, the sea would\nsweep over the bow, and then we would lurch up with the bow nearly out\nof the water as the ship headed over the crest and then pitched down\ninto the following trough as the next wave approached. It went on like\nthis for about two days.\n\nIt wasn’t much fun, but we were not alarmed. Everyone was doing their\njob as a team to ensure that the ship got through. Finally, the storm\nsubsided, and we headed home for Japan unscathed.\n\nIt only takes about one such time in your life going through something\nlike this to make you realize that your life is dependent upon the lives\nand work of others. “Esprit De Corps” is real. It is necessary. It is\nwhat makes the world work, and we need more of it.",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n Are We A Government Of One?\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nMay 31, 2025\n\n Rolland Kidder\n\nTo be honest, I have been dismayed recently by the actions of both\npolitical parties in what I would call a surrendering of our country to\na “government of one.”\n\nStarting first with the Democrats, it is clear that in deference to the\ndesires of a former President–they deferred into looking more closely at\nthe ability of Joe Biden to run again for that office.\n\nIt is now clear that there were many warning signs prior to Biden’s\nfailed debate performance last June, and that he should not have been\nthe presumptive Democratic nominee for President. Because of the power\nof the Presidency, Democrats in high places essentially “rolled over,”\nhoped for the best, and didn’t act until it was too late.\n\nThey erred in so doing, and more viable candidates for the highest\noffice in the land were thus thwarted in seeking that office. To put it\nbluntly, one of our major political parties failed the country. The\npower of the Presidency, the power of one — overpowered the traditional\npolitical process of the Democratic Party.\n\nNow, we are compounding the problem by what seems to be the virtual\nabandonment of the Republican Party in opposing in any way the current\nPresident. Members of Congress, when President Trump says “Jump!”–they\nrespond, “How high?!”\n\nThere appears to be little or no backbone in the Republican Congress\nwhen it comes to proposals from the White House. It can be 145% tariffs\ntoday, and 30% tariffs tomorrow. It can be taking a gift of half a\nbillion dollars from a sheikh in Arabia so that our President can have a\nplush airplane with a gilded interior, or have him telling American\nUniversities that they must parrot the messaging of the federal\ngovernment or be shut down.\n\nWhatever comes out of the White House now is apparently infallible, and\nthe law of the land is to be set by executive decree.\n\nHowever you look at it, I see in all of this a demeaning of our\nconstitutional government. The Constitution was written to give the\ncongress, the executive and the courts equal jurisdiction over our\naffairs as a nation. If any branch of the government was to have a\nleading role, it was to have been the congress through the power of the\npurse strings.\n\nNow we stand in awe, apparently as helpless as sheep, while in the dead\nof night the House of Representatives rubber stamps the White House by\nripping down a great part of the government previously created by other\nRepublican and Democratic administrations to pay for unneeded tax cuts\naccelerating the deficit. All put altogether in a “one big Beautiful\nBill!”–whatever that means.\n\nI doubt that many members of Congress even knew what was in it. It was\ntoo much for at least one Republican member of the House from Long\nIsland who fell asleep that night somewhere in halls of Congress and\ndidn’t wake up for this monumental vote.\n\nIt seems that maybe the whole country is asleep. When will this end? It\nhas taken over 200 years, through fits and starts, successes and\nfailures, but, for the most part, with good intentions, to build this\ncountry making it the leader of the free world.\n\nNow we seem to be giving it all up to be ruled by a government of one.\nWe shouldn’t be going down this road. This is not what made America\ngreat.",

There are jobs that cannot be done\nat home using only a computer and an internet connection.\n\nIt is not just dental work; it is most medical work.

And, yes,\ndespite automation, human beings actually have to be involved when cows\nare being milked.\n\nNot everything can be done by computer. There is a lot that can’t be\ndone by just asking “Siri” or “Alexa” to do it.\n\nThe band Alabama has a song which goes right to this point titled “Forty\nHour Week For A Livin’.” Here is one verse from those lyrics:\n\n“This is for the one who drives the big rig\n\nUp and down the road\n\nOr the one out in the warehouse\n\nBringing in the load\n\nOr the waitress, the mechanic\n\nThe policeman on patrol\n\nFor everyone who works behind the scenes\n\nWith a spirit you can’t replace with no machine.”\n\nAnd then the song ends with this: “Hello America, let me thank you for\nyour time.”\n\nSometimes it’s good to reflect on the human requirements that keep our\nsociety moving.

Even the orders taken and\nprocessed by AI, have to be delivered in a cardboard box by someone\ndriving a van who takes the item ordered to the customer.\n\nAs to 40 hours a week, that is just a wish for many who are working to\nmake ends meet. There are a lot of people working out there behind the\nscene, that can’t be replaced “with no machine.” We need to be mindful\nand grateful for that.\n\nHello, America…let me thank you for your time!",

It is\ngood to have a world leader who brings spiritual perspective and\ncontinuity and who is not caught up in the day-to-day political battles\nthat are always occurring between nations around the globe. The Pope, as\nleader of his church, stands for something more.\n\nThere was elation in this country that the new Pope was an American.\nYet, he is not an American Pope. He is a Pope who was born in America.\nHe is everyone’s Pope. He is the world’s Pope.\n\nA good friend of mine, who is a strong, committed Catholic, was greatly\nmoved by the selection of Pope Leo XIV. As he put it: “As an\nAugustinian, and just like Pope Francis, who was a Jesuit, the new Pope\ntook vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. That certainly is a life\nthat I could not follow, and I respect anyone who can follow those\nvows.”\n\nIsn’t it heartening that not all leadership in the world is driven by a\ndesire for power or money? We don’t measure a Pope by how big his bank\naccount is or by how many houses he owns. We look to him for spiritual\nand moral leadership.\n\nBack in the days when I was a Methodist seminarian in the Chicago area,\nthrough ecumenical/inter-school conferences, I came to know some Jesuit\nseminarians. It gave me a glimpse into the world of the Roman Catholic\npriesthood.\n\nIt is a monumental commitment that these men make. Not only do they make\na commitment to the Christian ministry, but they must also commit to the\ncelibate life of an all-male priesthood.\n\nSome of the Catholic seminarians that I met eventually left their\ntraining because they had fallen in love and wanted to get married. It\nhas been my view since then that the Catholic Church would be better\nserved if it allowed and recognized a married clergy. There are enough\nchallenges to be confronted by those in the Christian ministry without\nalso saddling them with a mandate that they cannot marry, have kids or\nraise a family.\n\nAs a non-Catholic, it is something that someday I hope will change. I\nbelieve that it would strengthen and not diminish the Roman Catholic\nChurch.\n\nBut back to the present–the new Pope seems to be a good choice. He is\nmulti-lingual and spoke in Latin, Italian and Spanish when introduced to\nthe crowd at St. Peter’s Square. He spent 20 years as a missionary in\nPeru and also holds Peruvian citizenship. Yet, he also still calls\nChicago home. He is truly the world’s Pope.\n\nOur world needs strong spiritual and moral leadership, and it looks like\nwe have that in Pope Leo XIV. The only perceived weakness I can find in\nhim is that he is apparently a White Sox fan, and I have always rooted\nfor the Cubs!",

      "text": "THE FIRST NEW ARTICLE\n\n May 3, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nHaving recently reread James Madison’s Journal of the Federal\nConvention, (the last time being in college) reminded me of the old\nadage that “he who speaks last, speaks first.”\n\nBen Franklin did not speak much at the convention, but when he is\nrecorded as having done so his remarks were usually general and positive\nin nature – this despite the fact that there was much disagreement and\nacrimony between the delegates.\n\nWhile members were signing the final document, Franklin “looking toward\nthe President’s (George Washington’s) chair” observed that an image of\nthe sun had been carved into the back of it. He had not been sure\nwhether it was a “rising” or “setting” sun but now, at the end of this\ncontentious convention, he was sure that it was a “rising, and not a\nsetting sun.”\n\nFranklin was old at the time, and the seemingly endless proceedings took\nplace over a hot summer in Philadelphia. For secrecy and privacy\nreasons, the windows in Independence Hall were kept closed. That he\ncould sit there for four months through the heat, often boring debate\nand parliamentary squabbles, is quite a remarkable accomplishment in\nitself.\n\nTo read Madison’s Journal is a grind, as most of it is written in the\nway you would write up the minutes of any formal meeting – roll call\nvotes, votes to refer to committees, reports from committees, arguments\nabout quorums, etc.\n\nAnd underlying the proceedings was an expressed disappointment in the\nstatus of the country at that time – a pessimism about its future. Many\nof the delegates had come from state legislatures and did not hold them\nin high regard. Many comments were made about the self-serving nature of\npoliticians, “exotic corruption,” “office hunting,” and the “mischievous\ninfluence of demagogues.”\n\nIn response to these concerns, some had proposed limiting participation\nin the new federal government to “natives” only, to those born in the\ncountry.

That local school kids\ncan put on such an exceptional performance combined with all of the\nchoreography and building of stage sets–is a great testament to our\nsystem of public education.\n\nAs a grandparent of kids so involved, it makes me not a disinterested\nobserver. When I go to one of these performances, I am all in. I keep my\nhandkerchief close by as I know that at some point in the performance, I\nam going to tear up.\n\nOne aspect of it is that “musicals,” as we know them, are primarily an\nAmerican phenomenon. They are a Broadway thing. People from all over the\nworld come to New York every year just to experience the latest American\nmusical.\n\nYou never know what the Broadway crowd is going to cook up. I was\nespecially impressed a few years back when the musical “Hamilton” came\nout. I thought it would be a flop. How could anyone make a conservative\n“straight arrow” banker like Alexander Hamilton into a Broadway star?\nBut they did it! It has been one of the biggest hits ever.\n\nFor the student participants in these local school musicals, the whole\nexperience has to be unforgettable. Our grandson explained it this way:\n\n“When we first started rehearsing, nobody knew anything about the play,\nhad never heard most of the songs, and many of us had never done a dance\nroutine. We thought we could never pull it off. Then, one day, it hit\nus–we realized that we actually could do it. Then it all came together.”\n\nAnd did it ever! The standing ovation at the end, said it all.\nHandkerchiefs throughout the crowd came out of pockets. You would have\nthought it was Broadway itself.\n\nOf course, the unheralded hero in the whole show was the\nteacher/director who had taken this raw material of untested talent and\nmolded it all into a show. The choreography, the beauty of the stage\nset, the lighting, the musical accompaniment, the singing–without a\ndirector, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\nThe “Americanness” of it all also hit me. Here we were, in a public\nschool, in an audience coming from all different directions and\noutlooks, cheering and appreciating what these kids were doing. It was\nbeautiful. You don’t find this happening in many foreign countries.\n\nSometimes, I find the storyline in these musicals to be a bit hoaky and\nsyrupy. But that doesn’t matter. The power of music combined with a\nplay–outside of opera, there is nothing that compares to it.\n\nKudos to our schools, kids, teachers, and parents for sponsoring again\nthe Great American Musical!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

Among\nothers, our first President, George Washington, in his farewell address,\ncautioned the new nation about becoming entangled in the affairs of\nother nations.\n\nBut, the history of our country and the world changed. Whether we liked\nit or not, we were thrust into world affairs in the twentieth century by\nboth World War I and World War II. America became the leader of the free\nworld. In that capacity, we forged international agreements and\nalliances to keep the peace.\n\nWe also encouraged international trade and commerce as a necessary part\nof keeping nations engaged with each other, instead of making war on\neach other. There was at least one good outcome to the terrible toll of\nhuman life in World War II–we helped rebuild the two enemies we had\ndestroyed, Germany and Japan. They became bulwarks of freedom and\ndemocracy and have become strong allies in Europe and the Pacific.\n\nNow, with the Trump tariffs, we are marching backwards. We are trying to\ngo it alone, to dictate to other countries the terms of trade and\ncommerce. We are building a wall around ourselves. Our message to other\nnations is clear: “You need us, we don’t need you!” Where will it end?\n\nWhen the President announced his new tariffs, he referenced a list of\nmany countries and their tariff rates on U.S. goods. One was\nBangladesh…one of the poorest countries in the world which he said had a\ntariff rate of about 80%. Now, the United States, I expect, will impose\nthat same rate on them…a “reciprocal” tariff.\n\nWhat does this mean? It obviously doesn’t mean that we will sell more\ncars or much of anything else to Bangladesh. However, it does mean that\nthe United States will now put an 80% tax on consumer goods like\nclothing, T-shirts, etc. that come from Bangladesh. Who gets hurt? Not\nBangladesh…but Americans who wear T-shirts and other clothes\nmanufactured there.\n\nBrilliant – talk about shooting yourself in the foot. It is primarily\nAmericans who are going to foot the bill for Trump’s tariffs.\n\nBut, what to me is more worrisome, is the attitude of arrogance being\ndisplayed by our country. “It is our way or the highway. Get out of the\nway if you don’t like it!” What a way to win friends and influence\npeople around the world.\n\nPerhaps, the most egregious treatment that has been dished out by this\nadministration is upon Canada and Canadians…next door neighbors and\nlongstanding friends of ours. They too are supposed to get in line and\nfollow us over the cliff we have created. If they continue to object by\nbanning American whiskey from their shelves, good for them. Maybe it\nwill wake up some people in Washington… or at least those who represent\nKentucky.\n\nGoing it alone is not the American way. We are on a bad path right now.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

The way we were brought up, what we were taught,\nwhere we were born–all of it is a “windshield” through which we see and\nunderstand the world.\n\nI think it is this “windshield” which makes it so hard to comply with\nthe golden rule… “love thy neighbor as thyself.” Trying to see the world\nthrough someone else’s eyes is not easy.\n\nJust think about the war-torn areas of the world today. Your\n“windshield” is a lot different if you suffered through this past winter\nin Gaza versus living in Israel, or if you are in the trenches of\nUkraine or trying to attack those trenches as a soldier for Russia. It\nis hard to apply the golden rule in such situations.\n\nIn thinking back to my own childhood, my view of life was pretty much\nshaped by the experiences of growing up on a dairy farm in Chautauqua\nCounty. The “city kids” that I knew and palled around with lived in the\nCity of Jamestown. That was what “city” meant to me. It wasn’t until I\ngot to Chicago, after college, that I really found out what urban living\nwas all about.\n\nProbably the biggest eye-opener for me as to seeing “life through a\nwindshield” came with the years that I was in the Navy. It was here that\nI came in contact with men from all over the country. When you work on a\ndaily basis with people coming from such diverse places as New York City\nto rural Texas…you soon become aware that your own “windshield” is a\nfairly small prism.\n\nThe fact that we no longer have a military draft has, in my opinion,\naccelerated the sense of division and separateness that now\ncharacterizes the country. We are no longer thrown into the melting pot\nof military service where we are exposed to people and views from across\nthe land.\n\nI also remember the false hope that somehow the availability of the\ninternet would bring about a sense that we lived in a global village of\nsome kind. Instead, the internet and television have made it easier to\nget into our “caves” or “cocoons” where we get our news or can\ncommunicate in echo chambers with only like-minded people.\n\nHumanity, of course, is always going to have differences based on race,\nethnicity, country of origin and political opinion dependent on the\nstructures of government we have known. We cannot overlook these\ndifferences.\n\nBut, it is important that we realize and understand that those\ndifferences create a “windshield” through which we see the world.\n\nThe truck driver rolling down the road realizes that not only is he\nseeing the world through a windshield…so is everyone else on the road.\n\nWith that realization comes humility. We are not the “only pebble on the\nbeach.” There are billions of other human beings out there seeing the\nworld through their own “windshields.” Understanding that, I think, may\nbe the beginning of wisdom.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

This impression was\nmagnified when the President, himself, thanked Schumer for lending\nsupport to the Continuing Resolution (CR) to keep the government running\nthrough September.\n\nI am not entirely a disinterested observer in all of this, since many\nyears ago I served with Senator Schumer when he was an Assemblyman in\nthe New York State Assembly. While there, and in his subsequent roles in\nthe Congress of the United States, I have found him to be honest and\npragmatic in his approach to government. He also, despite having had big\nresponsibilities in Washington, has paid attention to his Upstate New\nYork constituents and visits each county of the state every year.\n\nBut, to get back to Senator Schumer’s decision to support the CR, I\nthought it made both substantive and political sense. Substantively, a\ngovernment shutdown on top of all of the chaos associated with the\ndismantling of government and layoffs that have been going on under the\nleadership of the President and Elon Musk would have been devastating\nfor the country.\n\nOn the political side of things, though more liberal members of his\nparty wanted him to stand up to Trump and shut down the government,\nSchumer made the pragmatic decision that to do that would just heap\npolitical criticism on the Democrats. A shutdown would have given\nRepublicans, who now control the levers of power in Washington, an easy\nscapegoat to blame Democrats for the additional chaos which would have\nfollowed with even more negative consequences.\n\nSchumer saw through that and did his party and his country a favor by\nsupporting passage of a bill in the Senate to keep the government\nrunning – though I am sure there was lot in it that he didn’t like\n\nIn my view, it took political courage for Schumer to do this. He is\ntaking some short-term political flack for his position, but, in the\nlong-run, it was the right and smart thing to do both politically and\nfor the country.\n\nChuck Schumer, unlike the President, has a long history in and knowledge\nof how government works. In truth, government has an important role to\nplay in our society. Sometimes it can overreach and become bloated, but\nwhat it does is address needs that the private sector does not or cannot\ndo – like public safety, public infrastructure, a court system, public\nschools, food and meat inspection, environmental standards, healthcare\nsupport, running a National Park Service, maintaining roads and bridges,\nfunding social security and the military and all of the other myriad of\nthings that we take for granted in this great country of ours.\n\nSo, Senator Schumer, thanks for standing up and doing the right thing.\nYou may be getting criticism from some quarters, but, for what it’s\nworth, your stock is still strong up here, in that part of the state\nnorth and west of the Tappan Zee Bridge – that demarcation line south of\nwhich lies the great majority of this state’s residents and voters.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

If it were done in school,\nthe teacher would send the student involved to the principal’s office.\n\nActually, it was more than bullying. President Zelensky was bushwhacked\nbetween the two hammering voices of President Trump and Vice-President\nVance. This was no spontaneous, unplanned event. They were out to\nsurprise and crush the Ukrainian President in a coordinated way.\n\nAs an American, I was ashamed and embarrassed.\n\nTo Trump though, it was a victory. “This is going to be great\ntelevision,” he said. An observation that fits with his general “modus\noperandi.”\n\nWhen Tony Schwarz ghost-wrote in 1987 the book “Art of the Deal” for\nTrump, the publisher showed Mr. Trump a copy of what the proposed book\nwould look like. Trump liked it, did not comment on its content, but\nsaid: “Please make my name much bigger.” That was done on the cover, and\nthe book became a bestseller.\n\nThe same Donald Trump, our current President, now in his first chaotic\ndays of a second term, seems to be consistent, at least on that point.\nEven if the news is not good, as long as the Trump name gets top\nbilling, it is a success.\n\nAs Schwarz said in a follow-up interview after the book was published,\nTrump “seemed driven entirely by a need for public attention.” After\nspending decades as a tabloid titan, “the only thing left was running\nfor President. If he could run for emperor of the world, he would.”\n\nAs to that ambition, unfortunately, the President may be in for a\nsurprise. The world is not ready for an emperor, even an American\nemperor. We have to hope that others in the world will arise to remind\nus of our democratic roots and help steer us back in the direction of\nresponsible, representative government.\n\nThe Roman philosopher, Seneca, once wrote: “Caesar and the state are one\nand the same.” It was opposition to that kind of thinking that brought\nAmerica into being. We didn’t want Caesar or the King of England running\nthis country.\n\nWhen asked what kind of government the Constitutional Convention had\nproposed, Ben Franklin is purported to have said: “A Republic if you can\nkeep it.” Now is a time when we need to be focused on “keeping it.”\n\nBullying a beleaguered leader of a country that was invaded and is\nfighting for its life as a democracy is not the American way.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a former New York state\nAssemblyman.\n\nTop of Form",

International leaders and members of military alliances\nwhich we helped create need to understand that we are now the boss.”\n\nAnd, as to free trade, especially here in North America: “Forget about\nfree trade agreements. The United States is going to slap a 25% tariff\non Canada and Mexico, unless they do exactly what we tell them to do.”\n\nTeddy Roosevelt, who, I believe, everyone would concede was a strong and\noutspoken President–exercised American power by “speaking softly but\ncarrying a big stick.” Now, we speak loudly, brandish the big stick, and\ntell other countries that we will act for our own benefit regardless of\nwhat they think.\n\nAll of this is sad to me. This is not the America I grew up with. This\nis not making America great again. It is the way of banana republics and\nautocrats.\n\nAnd, the idea that a clown like Elon Musk, can come into the government\nwith a “meat axe” approach and actually know what he is cutting…is a\njoke. Apparently, it doesn’t matter that the United States Agency for\nInternational Development was created and supported by both Republican\nand Democratic parties in the past. Now, in the name of government\nefficiency, it is to be abolished by fiat from Elon Musk and the White\nHouse.\n\nWhat about the program instituted by President George W. Bush to combat\nthe epidemic of AIDS throughout the world? What about food programs when\nthere are famines? Are not American farmers still the “bread-basket” of\nthe world? Does America not care anymore?\n\nEliminating some programs because they are wasteful or inefficient could\nbe understood, but eliminating an entire agency created by the Congress\nto address such issues… is just plain wrong.\n\nThe GOP now seems to have only one mantra…and that is “follow the\nleader.” Whatever he says goes. Wherever he leads us, we will follow. It\nreminds me of the Pied Piper leading a mesmerized crowd over the cliff.\n\nMuch of this new approach to government seems to be driven by inflaming\nfear and discord. Fear has always been an easy sell. Yet, driving wedges\nbetween people and nations has not been the American way.\n\nWhere it will all end, we don’t know.\n\nOne bright spot came last week, when a federal prosecutor with strong\nRepublican credentials, quit her job in the Southern District of New\nYork rather than follow orders from Washington to stop criminal charges\nagainst the Mayor of the City of New York. She viewed such orders as\nblatantly illegal and a violation of legal and judicial ethics.\n\nThis is what it will take to turn things around. People, like her, will\nhave to stand up to officials in high places when they are leading us in\nthe wrong direction.",

But, I will have to admit, that I\nwas cheering on the Eagles … primarily because a local guy and graduate\nof Southwestern Central School was coaching them.\n\nI have never met Nick Sirianni, but you felt like you got to know him\nwith all of the press coverage leading up to the big event. Locally, he\nwill be honored this year as an inductee to the Chautauqua Sports Hall\nof Fame, joining his father and two brothers who are already there.\n\nOne interesting fact is that Nick Sirianni and Andy Reid, coach of the\nChiefs, have at least one thing in common–they have both been head coach\nof the Eagles. After being fired by the Eagles, Reid went on to his\nillustrious career at Kansas City. Two years ago, Reid’s team defeated\nPhiladelphia in the Super Bowl…but not this year.\n\nSirianni appears to have one characteristic that helped him out in\ngetting his team to the Super Bowl–he doesn’t get rattled by bad press.\nEarly in the season, he had actually been booed by some Philadelphia\nfans because the team had lost two games.\n\nSirianni didn’t cave…he doubled down. He knew that he had a good team.\nHe reiterated that to his players, and they turned their season around.\nGetting sports teams to believe in each other is half the battle in\nwinning. That is what good coaches understand.\n\nOf course, locally, there were many stories written about Sirianni, his\nfamily and his growing up around here.\n\nI had not known, for example, that he was a childhood friend of Tom\nLangworthy, the football coach at JHS. There was a terrific story of how\nLangworthy could beat Sirianni in ping-pong–and, when it happened,\nSirianni would slam down his paddle. He didn’t like losing, even at\nping-pong.\n\nThe winning coach of the Super Bowl also has a large family presence\nhere. His Mom and Dad are long-time residents, his brother coaches\nfootball at Southwestern, and his nieces and nephew are student athletes\nthere.\n\nTo top it off, it was terrific that a guy born in Jamestown, NFL\nCommissioner Roger Goodell, would present the Vince Lombardy Trophy to\nanother guy born and raised around here–Nick Sirianni. It doesn’t get\nbetter than that, even if you are a Bill’s fan.\n\nAs to the Bills, maybe we “dodged a bullet” in losing to the Chiefs this\nyear in the playoffs. The way the Eagles were playing in the Super Bowl,\nI doubt that any team could have beaten them… and the Chiefs with\nPatrick Mahomes at quarterback are not just “any team.”\n\nSo, Nick Sirianni, congratulations on your great win! You deserved it,\nare a credit to your sport, and we are proud that you came from this\ncommunity and remain close to your family and friends who live here!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

Apparently, mother nature doesn’t care if you are\na Republican or a Democrat when you are getting old.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the Democrat, who is my age, fell on some stairs at a\npalace in Luxembourg where she was commemorating with other members of\nCongress the 80th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. Some say that\nshe tripped because she still wears spike heels…but that, as far as I\nknow, has not been confirmed.\n\nThe Republican who has made similar news is Senator Mitch McConnell who\nfell in the Senate and apparently bruised his head and face pretty\nbadly. McConnel has been in the news over the past year with other\nslip-ups attributed to his advancing age.\n\nSo, just to re-emphasize…aging is not partial to your political\naffiliation. Father time doesn’t care if you are a Republican or a\nDemocrat. He just keeps marching on and includes everybody.\n\nSome in my family think that I shouldn’t write about getting old…but I\nsort of look at it as an obligation. Older people can learn from others\ngoing through it, and younger people might benefit by knowing what is\ncoming.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with aging. Everyone ages. But, not everyone\nwants to deal with or embrace its reality. We were meant to age.\n\nAlso, I have never met anyone who is getting older who at one time\nwasn’t younger. This may sound a bit like a Yogi Berra quote, but it is\nthe truth.\n\nA reverse way to state it is: “old bones don’t get young.” I am living\nproof of that. When you are my age, over 80–it is probably time to give\nup some things…like downhill skiing on black diamond slopes.\n\nWhen my parents were this age, nobody had ever heard of knee, hip or\nshoulder replacements. Now, it is uncommon when you don’t know somebody\nwho has just gone through one or is scheduled for surgery to have a new\njoint implanted somewhere in their body.\n\nThe “fool’s gold,” of course, in having this done is that the new,\nartificial joints are being added to old bones. A “new” hip or knee may\nwell improve your mobility and reduce pain. But, be not fooled–they are\nnot the only things wearing down in your body.\n\nI have repeated before in this column advice from my doctor who always\ntells me when I have a physical exam: “Just slow down and live within\nyourself!”\n\nNot bad advice, I would say, for all Republicans or Democrats who have\nbeen around for seven or eight decades. Mother nature is totally\nbipartisan. Respect and enjoy these later years.\n\nAnd, if all else fails, as the old country song says: “Nail your shoes\nto the kitchen floor, get up and bar the door, and thank the Lord for\nthe roof’s that’s over you!”\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

      "text": "Remembering an Old Friend\n\nA few weeks ago, an old friend died—Paul Bush.\n\nHis passing was not immediately known here. He had quietly lived for\nmany years in Florida in his retirement. He was no longer “making waves”\nin this community...though, at one time, he had made many.\n\nIt doesn’t take long for memories to fade. As Alfred Lord Tennyson once\npoignantly wrote: “The old order changeth, yielding place to new.”\n\nBut, one advantage in being old, like me, is that I still have vivid\nmemories. I can tell you of being a kid five years old and celebrating\nthe end of World War II in downtown Jamestown where the car horns were\nblaring, people were partying in the street and kids were yelling “the\nwar is over, the war is over!”\n\nI can reminisce about growing up on a dairy farm, milking cows and\nworking with my Dad on the farm.\n\nAnd, I can still remember some of the “movers and shakers” in Jamestown.\nOne of those was Paul Bush.\n\nWhen I first met Paul, he was an up-and-coming businessman from Little\nValley who had inherited a family business and was bringing new life\ninto it. You could probably call him an “interloper” as he wasn’t born\nand raised in Chautauqua County. He was a “Catt. County guy.”\n\nYet, to Chautauqua County he came, along with the vision of creating a\ncompany to manufacture “ready to assemble” furniture. The county offered\nhim a site for a new factory in the Mason Industrial Park. He endorsed\nthe idea and came.\n\nOn the day that the financing was finalized to make the new factory\npossible, Paul was playing golf with a friend of mine at Moonbrook. They\nwere on # 7 green, and a golf cart came speeding up with a couple of\nbankers yelling and screaming to Paul... “we got the financing, we got\nthe financing!”\n\nPaul thanked them for the news, and, after they left, he turned to his\nplaying partner and said: “I don’t know if I should be smiling or\ncrying. Now, we can build a business, but we also have the bankers to\npay.”\n\nWell, he did build that business, and it was very successful. There are\nnow new owners of the business, but Bush Industries continues as a\nsignificant employer in the area. Think of all the people employed and\nthe economic good that has been done for our county over the past 40\nyears.\n\nPaul was always generous, and many still remember the 4^(th) of July\nparties at his home in Lakewood. Sometimes, when called upon, he would\ncontribute financially to ensure that there would be the annual\nfireworks display in the village.\n\nPerhaps his greatest contribution to the community was the day that he\ngifted the Jamestown Tennis Center to the YMCA. Without that gift, there\nwould not be the Lakewood YMCA that we now enjoy.\n\nGoodbye, old friend. You did a lot of good here in this community. You\nwill be greatly missed.\n\n[photo]\n\n 11961447.pdf\n\nPaul S. Bush\n\nMay 5, 1936 – January 22, 2025",

I guess the difference this time is that\npersonal loyalty seems paramount over experience and more political\nappointees are coming from the news/entertainment business.\n\nThat, in itself, should not be a surprise, as the President-elect\nhimself came from that job sector. Yet, in his first administration he\ntended to nominate people for positions like Secretary of Defense who\nactually had the experience and knowledge for the job.\n\nThis is not meant to bash the President-elect on all of his\nappointments. For example, a western Governor from the State of North\nDakota has been nominated to run the Interior Department. The federal\ngovernment controls/owns a lot of property in the West, so this nominee\nhas had first-hand knowledge and experience in dealing with the\nDepartment of the Interior.\n\nA former Congressman and candidate for Governor in New York has been\nnominated to run the EPA. Though not noted as an environmental\nprotection guy, he comes from a part of the country where environmental\npolicy has a big impact. He is smart, has held public office and should\nbe able to do the job. The fact that he endorsed Mr. Trump is not\ndisqualifying…this is the way of American politics.\n\nBut, that brings us to Hulk Hogan who, as far as I know, is still a\nrough and tumble ex-wrestler. He made a big appearance at the Republican\nConvention and is close to the President. Where would he fit in?\nPerhaps, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would be a\ngood fit.\n\nAnother factor about HHS is that it is proposed to be headed up by\nRobert Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, who is known for having some half-baked\nideas about healthcare. Kennedy is going to have his hands full and will\nneed guidance in running this department of about 80,000 people. Maybe\nHulk Hogan is the man who can provide the needed advice.\n\nI expect though that Hogan’s most likely landing spot will be at the\nDepartment of Education which is supposed to be headed by the former CEO\nof WWE. Sports as entertainment has likely been overlooked as an\neducational priority by the federal government and Hogan could fix that.\n\nEnough speculation. “To the victor belong the spoils.” The Senate now\nhas the job of vetting cabinet members and various other appointees.\n\nThe political campaign is over. Vice President Harris participated in\nthe certification proceedings affirming Donald Trump to be the winner in\nthe electoral college. No one tried to interfere in the process, and no\none was breaking into the Capitol… like we had four years ago.\n\nThe Republicans had a big election. They now have the responsibility of\ngoverning.

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\nJimmy Carter: A Life Well-Lived\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nJan 4, 2025\n\nRolland Kidder \n\nAmerica lost an icon this past week…Jimmy Carter. In many ways, he was\nan anomaly in our national politics–a peanut farmer who came from\nnowhere to win the Presidency.\n\nWhen I say “nowhere,” I do not mean to disrespect the people of Plains,\nGeorgia. But, even people from Plains would never have predicted it. To\nbring it close to home, it would be like someone from around here\npredicting that Robert Jackson from Frewsburg, N.Y. would become a U.S.\nAttorney General, Supreme Court Justice and Chief American Prosecutor at\nNuremberg.\n\nThese things just don’t happen very often.\n\nWhat drew me to Carter, I expect, is just that fact–he came from the\nkind of rural background that I grew up in. He was what, in New York, we\nwould call an “upstate Democrat,” and both he and his wife, Rosalynn,\ncame and campaigned here in Western New York.\n\nIn the process, in 1980, I became a Carter delegate to the Democratic\nNational Convention. Though his prospects for re-election didn’t look\ngood at the time, I believed that he personified the kind of human being\nthat we should want to have in the White House. The fact that he lost\nthat election, has never changed my mind as to the genuine humility,\nkindness and goodness of this man.\n\nA lot of things can cost people elections, but character was not one of\nthem as far as Jimmy Carter was concerned. He was smart, strong, and,\nsometimes, could be a stubborn man. He was also a person of faith. He\nnot only taught Sunday School, but he believed that the principles he\nwas teaching there should be carried out in real life.\n\nAfter the Presidency, these attributes magnified themselves. His\ninvolvement in the early days of Habitat for Humanity is a case in\npoint. One commentator called it “the theology of the hammer.” It wasn’t\ngood enough just to be a Christian in church. You had an obligation to\nserve others and to work for their benefit in the wider world.\n\nRecent comments on his passing may well remain true–that he may be the\nonly President whose high office was a stepping-stone to something\nperhaps more significant. Carter could have been awarded the Nobel Peace\nPrize just for his work as President in forging peace in the Middle East\nbetween Egypt and Israel. But, the Nobel award was also based on his\npost-Presidency efforts through the Carter Center in advancing health,\npeace and democratic initiatives throughout the world.\n\nDuring the time I was involved in Washington with the World War II\nMemorial, I became good friends with one of Carter’s former staff\nleaders in the White House, Frank Moore.\n\nAfter serving in the White House, Frank and his colleague, Jody Powell,\nstayed in the Washington area and purchased some property on the eastern\nshore of the Chesapeake. For 25 or 30 years, the former President would\ncome there late in the fall for duck hunting. Carter, the country boy\nfrom Georgia, loved the out-of-doors and was a sportsman at heart. Yet,\nit was also the camaraderie of the hunt, and the personal friendships\nthat surrounded it that really made it special.\n\nFrank and the former President became good friends during those times.\nIn 2002, Frank and Nancy Moore were invited by the Carter’s to accompany\nthem to Oslo where Carter would receive the Nobel Prize.\n\nFrank told me that in the week or two preceding his death, the former\nPresident remained cognizant and responsive. Rosalynn Carter died last\nyear. She and Jimmy had been married for 77 years. As the end drew near,\nJimmy Carter told those caring for him that he was ready to die and\n“wanted to be with Rosalynn.”\n\nHis prayer was granted. He is at peace now.\n\nJimmy Carter…a life well-lived.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form",

It was a\nwell-crafted, articulate analysis by the Prime Minister as to where the\nworld order was going under Trump’s leadership.\n\nPerhaps, the nub of that speech came when Carney warned that the United\nStates was now leading the world not into a “transition” to a new\ninternational system of governance but to a “rupture” in what we have\ncome to know since World War II as a system defined by the rule of law.\n\nCarney’s speech was not one of grievance, but one of stating the reality\nof what has been going on since Trump became President in 2025. The\nPresident of the United States has not only thrown Canada “under the\nbus,” he has openly criticized most of America’s former allies in one\nway or another.\n\nNoteworthy in Mr. Carney’s speech was that he didn’t stop at just\ndescribing the situation as he sees it, he offered a new approach—that\nit was time for the “middle powers” in the world, like Canada, to seek\nnew alliances between themselves to insure that democracy and the rule\nof law continue as the basis for international diplomacy.\n\nThe existing established order, which came out of World War II and was\nled by the United States, created international institutions and\nalliances to keep the peace. That order is now being shredded, and the\nworld can no longer count on the United States as it has in the past.\nCanada and other democracies are adapting to this new reality.\n\nAs an American, though I appreciated the brilliance and truthfulness of\nthe Prime Minister’s speech—it was a sad day. The Trump administration’s\n“go-it-alone” foreign policy now being applied with an arrogance that we\nhave never seen—has marginalized the United States on the world stage.\n\nThe Prime Minister of Canada spoke truth to power. We are forcing our\nformer allies to find new ways to keep the peace in order to preserve\ndemocracy in the world—what could be more tragic? Our “go it alone,”\nAmerica first (and only, it seems) strategy is destroying the\ncredibility of the United States of America.\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

As a matter of fact, it came just a few hours\nbefore midnight. But, last week, the House of Representatives\nacted…avoiding a federal government shutdown.\n\nThe last-minute vote wasn’t a total surprise, since tough votes are\noften not taken until deadlines are nearing. Yet, what made this one\nespecially special is that, as first proposed, it was attacked by\nincoming President Donald Trump and his new surrogate, Elon Musk.\n\nNo one knows what will happen with Speaker Mike Johnson when the new\nCongress convenes. Because of the messy way in which this needed\nlegislation ultimately passed, he may incur the wrath of Mr. Trump and\nnot be re-elected Speaker of the House.\n\nOn the other hand, members of the House might again select him as their\nleader. The bare Republican majority in the new Congress, makes it even\nmore difficult for the House to operate with just Republican votes.\nDespite being criticized for it, Speaker Johnson reached across the\naisle for Democratic votes when that became necessary to keep the\ngovernment running.\n\nThe big “bugaboo,” of course, in all of this, is the national debt.\nCongressmen and Presidents love to spend money though they don’t often\nlike to raise the taxes necessary to pay for it. Debt financing is\neasier. This means that the national debt keeps going up, and that has\nmeant that Congress has to keep raising the debt ceiling.\n\nMr. Trump has, from reports, suggested doing away with the debt ceiling\naltogether. That would give him (and any President) carte blanche power\nto take deficit spending to any level that they would want. Congress,\nrightly, wants to retain some control over the purse strings, and they\nshould. That role is given to them in the Constitution.\n\nA subplot in all of this is the part that Elon Musk will play in the new\nadministration. He publicly supported Mr. Trump in the election and\npoured a lot of money into his campaign. At one rally, Mr. Trump, in\nintroducing him said: “A new star is born, Elon Musk!”\n\nYet, Mr. Trump is also well known for not playing “second fiddle” to\nanyone. Musk needs to be careful and not overplay his hand.\n\nAlso, Musk is not known for listening to others even in his own business\ndealings. Working with the U.S. Congress is something he has never done.\nWhen it comes to politicians on Capitol Hill, he will be dealing with a\ndifferent breed of cat. Members of Congress have been directly elected\nby the people. Congress has its own role to play and will not easily be\npushed aside.\n\nI have a hunch, but it is just a hunch, that Mike Johnson might actually\nsurvive and be re-elected Speaker in the new Congress. He is a likeable\nguy and seems to have fewer political enemies than many other potential\ncandidates.\n\nA big fight to select a new Speaker would also likely result in a\nnon-functioning House of Representatives, as we saw two years ago when\nit took weeks to elect a Speaker. The winner of that particular contest,\nKevin McCarthy, lasted only a few months before being ousted.\n\nWe need the House of Representatives to fulfill its role under the\nConstitution. There is little to be gained for the country if Congress\nagain falls into chaos over electing a leader.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

This has been the case where some, alleging that it would\nimprove the environment, have been pushing to stop the use of all\nnatural gas in our state.\n\nJust think what that would mean? The largest source of the energy now\ngenerating electricity in the state would be cut-off. The cleanest\nfossil fuel that we have would be shut down. And, if you live in a place\nlike Western New York, you would have to find a new way to heat your\nhome. In Albany, even the Capitol would go cold.\n\nThis anti-natural gas policy is nonsense. Not only is it bad public\npolicy, it would devastate the state and cripple the electric grid if\nthese policies were to be carried out.\n\nI would characterize New York State as being duplicitous and two-faced\non the issue. In the name of cleaning up the environment, we abolished\nthe ability to explore and produce natural gas in the state. The DEC\nwon’t give permits anymore to drill and explore for natural gas to allow\nfor drilling in the shale, which is an immense resource in the state,\nespecially in the Southern Tier.\n\nOn the other hand, our state, including counties downstate and the City\nof New York, continue to consume great quantities of natural gas. As the\nold saying goes: “We want to have our cake and eat it to,” though in\nthis case it is natural gas we are talking about. Though we won’t\nproduce it, we want others to do so and send it to us for our energy\nneeds.\n\nWhat keeps the lights on in New York City right now is that there are\nstill some old natural gas peaking plants which get turned on, on very\ncold days or on hot summer days when the air-conditioning load is high\nand more electricity is required.\n\nWe could have more efficient peaking plants in New York City, but “No,”\nthat would violate our state-imposed mandate to stop using natural gas.\nSo, we keep using the old, less efficient gas turbine peaking plants.\nAll in the name of cleaning up the environment.\n\nSuch policies are, of course, nuts…but, it happens, here in New York!\n\nAnd, what about installing a natural gas generator so that you can have\npower in your house if the electrical grid does fail? I expect that the\n“deep thinkers” in Albany and New York will soon find a way to try and\nstop that as well.\n\nThe ultimate reality for me, of course, comes here at home. Our furnace\nand hot water are heated by natural gas. Gas is a much more efficient\nfuel in producing heat than electricity…but who cares about that?\n\nThen there is the fact that a few years ago, we put in a small but very\nefficient natural gas stove. My back has gotten older and no longer\nwants to stoke a wood stove. But now, at least, I have the alternative\nof putting my feet up, putting the recliner back, pushing a button and\nthen watching a beautiful blue flame heat the room and most of the\nhouse.\n\nThey are “barking up the wrong tree” when they start threatening to take\nnatural gas away. More people are starting to understand that, though, I\nexpect, it will take a few more elections and some energy interruptions\nbefore the situation ultimately gets turned around.\n\nSomeday, they may find a way to transport hydrogen or some other fuel\nsafely to my home. But, in the meantime, I am sticking with the blue\nflame!",

He\nsaid to them: “I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the\nearth.”\n\nIt is hard not to feel that way on Thanksgiving.\n\nI remember how tough it was on all of us during COVID time when we\ncouldn’t get together. We were back to full-normal this year with 22\ngathered for the big day. I have been married into this family now for\nover 50 years and every Thanksgiving, and every year on this day, I\nremember those words of Gehrig.\n\nThanksgiving is a national holiday and for good reason. But, for me it\nhas always been the biggest family day of the year. It is bigger than\nbirthdays, anniversaries or virtually anything else.\n\nI savor it, relish it, can’t wait for it to arrive and am sad when it is\nover. No gift giving, no great expectations, just enjoying and observing\nthe family and finding out what everyone is doing.\n\nWe were at our son’s home in Skaneateles, New York this year–and the\ntown always has a Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving. You can jog or just walk.\nThis year it was snowing…a wet, slushy, yucky kind of snow. But, that\ndidn’t matter. The townspeople gathered as usual along with\nout-of-towners like us. Somebody passed the hat for the food bank in\ntown, there were drinks and coffee, nobody was in a sour mood. Good\nfeelings all around. Thanksgiving.\n\nBack at home, before we left, there had been wonderful gestures leading\nup to the big day. The newspaper had reported on some churches and\nothers having organized an effort to provide Thanksgiving dinners to\nthose less fortunate. It is heartening to see all of this happening each\nyear.\n\nAt our Thanksgivings, the family sort of has a nonstop spontaneous\ndiscussion going on of what the past year has produced…the good and the\nbad, but mostly about the good. This year, the biggest news was that our\noldest granddaughter is pregnant, and people were speculating about how\nthis new addition would be the center of attention next year.\n\nWriters can sometimes be redundant, but when it comes to Thanksgiving–I\ndon’t care. Every year I get carried away and write about it. But, it is\nworth the write.\n\nThanksgiving always brings me back to what Lou Gehrig said. He is not\nalone. I consider myself to be the luckiest man on the face of the\nearth, and that is the truth.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

We had been out of\ntown, at one of our kids’ homes for the holiday. We drove back on\nSaturday in good weather and found two feet of snow in our driveway.\n\nFortunately, it had been plowed thanks to the snowplow guy.\n\nWe tend to forget about what winter around here is like. We have had\nsome easy ones, and, with four-wheel drive, you begin to think that you\ncan drive through anything. Then comes the lake-effect snow. Thank God\nfor the man who plows our driveway!\n\nThink though about what his life is like. He can’t take off for the\nweek-end, unless he has a buddy who will fill in for him. He has to be\nready to go at almost a moment’s notice. The weather man/woman is better\nat predicting the weather than they were years ago…thanks to the\npredictability of computer-generated weather modeling. But, still,\naround here, in snow country with lake effect snow…a lot of it can fall\nin a short time without a lot of notice.\n\nThen, think also of the investment. Snow plows today are not just an “up\nor down” relatively cheap mechanical machine. They have hydraulic\ncontrols which can collapse the plow into the form of a “V”, or direct\non which side of the road to push the snow. And, the plow must be ready\nto go all winter even if there is not a lot of snow.\n\nThen, there is the “time of day” question. Who wants to get up at 3 or 4\na.m. and start plowing driveways so that others can get up and go to\nwork at 6 or 7 a.m.? That takes a special kind of person.\n\nYou can’t stay up ’til midnight and watch the late show, and then think\nyou can jump in your truck and start plowing three or four hours later.\nLike everyone else, the snowplow guy needs his sleep.\n\nI grew up on a dairy farm and got used to getting up early to milk cows.\nOn snowy days, after milking, we would plow the driveway. In those days\nwe had a tractor with chains on it with a simple “up and down” plow to\npush the snow. The driveway needed to be plowed so that the milk hauler\ncould get to the milkhouse to pick up the milk cans.\n\nI don’t milk cows anymore, but I am still an early riser and need to be\nplowed out. I know that Hogan’s Hut will open at 6 a.m. and I want to be\nthere soon thereafter to buy the morning paper.\n\nSo sorry, Mr. Snowplow Driver. I am one of those guys that probably\nmakes your life miserable in the early morning hours after a snowy\nnight. Yet, I do appreciate what you do. Thanks for sticking around\ntown, getting up early and doing your work so that the rest of us can\ntravel and go on our way!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

Bad decisions at Defense can have catastrophic\nconsequences.\n\nNevertheless, I thought that good advice came this past week from New\nYork Democratic Congressman, Tom Suozzi. (You may remember him as the\nguy who unsuccessfully challenged Kathy Hochul in the primary for\nGovernor.)\n\nSuozzi’s advice as to Presidential appointments was as follows: “Let’s\nlook at what they’re proposing to do and their background, and let the\nSenate go through their process of vetting these candidates so that they\ncan decide whether or not to give their advice and consent to these\nappointments. I want to tell everybody, you know, calm down.”\n\nI thought Suozzi’s advice was good. You may not like some of these\nproposed appointments, but the election is over and now we must let the\nprocess play itself out.\n\nThe Senate has already rejected the President’s first pick for Attorney\nGeneral, Matt Gaetz, without even having a hearing. Five Republican\nSenators knew enough about him to tell the President… “don’t even send\nhis name up here.” Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration.\n\nWe all have our “wish-list” when it comes to our President. My “wish”\nfor this and every other President has been that they appoint strong,\nindependent-minded people to top jobs. The best example is probably\nAbraham Lincoln. He appointed a Secretary of State and Treasury\nSecretary both of whom had opposed him for the Republican nomination. He\nappointed a Democrat as Secretary of War.\n\nWhen you are President, you need strong leadership around you so that\nyou are not surrounded by only “yes men” (or women.) You need people who\nwill speak truth to power. Unfortunately, people who are close to power\ntend to tell their boss what they think he/she wants to hear. This is\nnot helpful in a place like the White House.\n\nWe know that the President-elect has not, as yet, recommended any of his\nopponents in this last campaign for cabinet positions. But, there is\nnothing we can do about that.\n\nSuozzi has it right. Don’t get all worked up over something you can’t\ncontrol. Calm down. Let the Senate do its job. The election is over.

Those friendships from years ago are still strong, and\nseveral from his class now live around here. We live in a place that\nnourishes a sense of home.\n\nYes, you can go live in the “hot spots” of the country like New York or\nL.A.–but there is nothing like home.\n\nThe schools here are also good, the cost of housing is less, and you\ndon’t have to drive in traffic for an hour to get somewhere.\n\nWe also are not a social or educational desert. We have colleges,\nlibraries and centers for the arts, education, law, comedy and culture.\nPlus, we are only a little more than an hour away from Bills Stadium!\n\nIn a bit over two hours, you can be in Cleveland…in three, you can be in\nToronto.\n\nAs to the job market–yes, we don’t have as many choices here. But, that\nis also changing as people become able to work more from home. We do\nhave high speed cable and fiber optic lines…the internet works fine\nhere!\n\nThere is another factor that I believe will be working in our favor as\ntime goes on…and that is climate.\n\nWe don’t have to live inside an air-conditioned space most of the year.\nWe can feel the cool breezes of the evening coming through our windows\nat night. And, despite our long winters, we have a pretty calm climate.\nOur lights don’t go out for weeks at a time because of hurricanes.\n\nAnd, though not exactly weather-related, we live on high ground. Worried\nabout floods? Not so much around here. Our people live from between 700\nft. above sea level along Lake Erie to over 2,000 feet on the Allegheny\nfoothills south of Frewsburg. The water all flows downhill from here!\n\nI see things gradually changing. Where can I go for good affordable\nschools? Where can I live to enjoy the out-of-doors? Where can I put\ndown roots where the grocery store and shopping is only a short drive\naway? Where can I live and make life-long friends?\n\nAnd, where can I live where a rising sea level is not a threat at all?\nTry living around here. You’ll like it!\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

After the June debate, it was clear that he could\nno longer articulate and lead a campaign for the Presidency.\n\nBiden eventually stepped aside, and endorsed his Vice President, Kamala\nHarris, to be the nominee in his stead. After that, we again had an\nelection going on in the country.\n\nIt has been an exhausting one. Just this past week, I read a news\narticle full of advice from a psychiatrist as to how people should deal\nwith election angst. Now, I expect that same person is providing advice\nas to how supporters of Harris should deal with post-election\ndepression.\n\nYet, remember, fair and free elections are central to our democracy. The\nsilver lining for every American is that we have just undertaken another\none. Some may not like the result, but all should rejoice in the fact\nthat we had an election…and a vigorous one at that.\n\nMy own view is that Harris acquitted herself well. In the time that she\nhad, she was able to make a case for why she should be the next\nPresident.\n\nThere were two major things, out of her control, that I believe\ncontributed to her defeat. First, she didn’t have a lot of time to\norganize and establish a campaign. President Biden waited too long,\nuntil just weeks before the Democratic Convention, before stepping\naside.\n\nThe second strike against her was inflation. Though the economy is now\nhumming along, people are still upset about inflation…especially the\nrise in food and housing prices. The party in power always gets blamed\nfor that, as was the case this time around.\n\nWe must also not forget that she was also running against an incumbent.\nDonald Trump is a former President. He has his own way of campaigning\nand is effective at it.\n\nAn old Republican friend contacted me about a week before the election\nasking who I thought would win the election. Though I sided with Harris,\nmy response to him was: “It is still Trump’s and for him to lose.” I had\nno scientific basis for making that statement, except for my “gut”\nreaction and years of experience watching and being involved in elected\npolitics.\n\nDespite my dislike of his divisive approach to politics and the way he\ndemeans his opponents, you have to admit that Donald Trump is skillful\nin the public arena. As one columnist said: “He bonds with supporters in\nan intimate, spontaneous, confessional way, unlike typical\npoliticians….”\n\nNow, we must hope for the best. We have seen him in action before. What\nwill now happen with Ukraine and the Middle East? Will he go after his\npolitical enemies? Maybe… and we can hope… he will want to leave a\nlegacy of positive accomplishment for his final term as President of the\nUnited States. We want our Presidents to succeed, not fail.\n\nThe election is over. It was not “stolen” either this time or the last\ntime. Harris has conceded and congratulated Mr. Trump. There will be a\npeaceful transition of power. The people have spoken. The decision has\nbeen made. Democracy has worked its way once again. We move on from\nhere.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

That\nchurch has been here forever it seems, at least in my memory.\n\nThough the decision is being appealed, it was just one of many churches\nbeing closed by the Diocese of Western New York consolidating them with\nother local parishes.\n\nThough it came as a “surprise,” it really shouldn’t have. Church\nattendance has been falling throughout Christendom, especially in the\nold, established Christian denominations that are spread out across our\ncountry.\n\nThe crisis has displayed itself not only in declining church attendance,\nbut in the decline in the ranks of the clergy. There are fewer priests\nand pastors being ordained to undertake the important work of leading\ncongregations. As one communicant put it to me: “We used to have a\nmonsignor, two priests and two or three nuns in our church. Now, we are\nsharing one priest between two or more churches. It is sad.”\n\nI should quickly add that these sentiments not only apply to Catholic\nchurches, but to most of what in Protestantism have been called\n“mainline churches.” Attendance at traditional Methodist, Presbyterian,\nLutheran and similar such churches has also been shrinking.\n\nSome more conservative churches may be holding their own, but, in\ngeneral, even there, church attendance and membership in America is on\nthe decline.\n\nI have heard that the problem was greatly accelerated by the COVID\npandemic. Gatherings of all kinds were cut back then, and in the case of\nmany churches, attendance has not bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nI write these reflections not because I have any great insight or way to\nturn this around. But, to me, it is sad. I can remember the day when the\nLatin Mass was said in the Catholic Church and the church was full, and\nwhen at least one service each week was preached in Swedish at some of\nthe Lutheran churches in town. Kids went to catechism or confirmation\nclasses after school – it was a part of our upbringing.\n\nIt wasn’t a perfect system but through it, you learned about values,\nmorals and humility… standards established under the watchful eye of a\ncreator as taught in the Church. Such teachings were a part of the\nsocial fabric in our communities.\n\nChange, they say, is inevitable, and secularization is now an\naccomplished fact in America. That doesn’t mean that I like all of it,\nnor does it mean that I am not worried about its repercussions. The\nchurches taught us that life is more than just a compilation of our\npersonal wants and desires.\n\nWhat will there be to replace them?\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

However, the one thing that I do\nlook forward to are the colors of fall foliage.\n\nRight across from my office window is a “burning bush” bush. As I write\nthis, it is bright red. I don’t mean a little bit red or a faded red…,\nbut a really fiery red! It almost looks as though someone with a spray\ngun came along and painted it red.\n\nMost colors in the fall are a bit more muted…but some maple trees can\nalso make you think of the burning bush…a bright and pure red.\n\nOn another recent autumn day, it was gray and had been raining most of\nthe day…but then the rain stopped, and the sun came out.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon and the sun’s rays were very angled,\noblique, almost parallel to the landscape. When the sun is like this, it\ncan light up the leaves of fall dramatically. My wife looked across the\nlake at the brilliance of it all with the trees in the distance lighted\nup against the black sky of a receding raincloud and said: “I have to\ntake a picture of this.”\n\nShe is good with her cell phone and went out on the porch and snapped\nthe picture. Soon it went out, “viral,” as they say, to our family over\nthe family chat, internet, “cloud,” or whatever you want to call it… and\nin seconds the phone was soon buzzing back with “isn’t it beautiful,”\n“wish I were there,” etc. etc. accompanied by what the new generation\ncalls “emojis,” things like smiling faces or “thumbs up” to show\nappreciation.\n\nOn such a day, you forget about the days when a blizzard can be whipping\ndown this frozen lake, when you can’t even see across to the other side.\n\nThis description may not be apt, but fall colors remind me a lot of the\npaintings of impressionists. The artists of this genre were\nexceptionally gifted at displaying the effects of light on a landscape.\nI think that my wife’s photo that day, if painted by such an artist,\nwould probably end up in an art gallery someplace.\n\nOkay, I may be getting a little teary-eyed about it all. I may even be\ngetting out of my league. Often the things that I write about are\nrelated to the human landscape and the controversies which surround\nus…not about views from our front window.\n\nBut, once in a while, I think it is okay to just sit back, relax and\ntake what mother nature gives you on the plus side.\n\nThere is a country song that speculates that if cowboys can’t get into\nheaven, then “take me to Texas, ’cause Texas is as close as I’ve been.”\nI would take issue with that.\n\nThink about a fall day with the sun shining down on the myriad colors of\nthe trees lining Chautauqua Lake. It may not be heaven, but until you\nget there, this may be “as close as you’ve been.”\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

It is just one more indication that the\npush to go all-electric is slowing down.\n\nThere are, of course, reasons for this–and it has to do primarily with\ncost and reliability issues. Having everything become electric sounds\ngood from an environmental perspective. But, now, people are coming to\ngrips with how much that will cost–and the fact that it may not be as\nreliable as advertised.\n\nNational Grid is now asking for a big rate increase before the Public\nService Commission–much of it related to increasing the capacity for the\ngrid to handle new renewable energy sources as well as projected\nincreases in electrical demand related to more electric vehicle use. The\npublic is just now realizing how much all of this is going to cost.\n\nI think, though, that the cooling fervor for electric vehicles (EV’s)\nhas also been driven by events – like the multiweek shutdown of the\nelectric grid in Houston after a big hurricane. Electric vehicles don’t\nwork very well when there is no electricity to charge the battery.\n\nOne of the other major weaknesses in electricity remains the problem of\nstorage. Companies are now making bigger batteries that can store more\nelectricity, but most batteries still run out of juice after a few\nhours. What happens when the grid is down for a few days?\n\nAll of this seems to be hypothetical until it happens to you…and then\npeople begin to change their thinking.\n\nYou cannot dispute that there are advantages to EV’s especially in their\nsimplicity. They have many fewer moving parts than a regular car… no\npistons, valves, transmissions, and drive chains to break down. Their\nenergy source, the battery and its dependence on the grid, is their weak\npoint…the rest of what makes them run is quite efficient.\n\nYet, the bottom line, I guess, is that people tend to be practical. So,\nif you offer them something like a hybrid vehicle, which can run on\nelectricity as well as gas, it is an option they may well take.\n\nIn any case, you can’t force energy decisions by just passing laws in\nAlbany or Washington that require energy conversions by a certain date,\ndeadlines which are then not met.\n\nNew discoveries will need to be made as to how electricity is generated\nand stored. My hope is that a new technology can be developed to control\nnuclear fusion, which would have great advantages over our current\nnuclear fission technology.\n\nIn the meantime, we will need a mix of energy fuels. Going all-electric\nis slowing down.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

Over two days the Armies of the Union traversed Pennsylvania\nAvenue, from the Capitol to the White House, a seemingly unending sea of\nsoldiers.\n\nIn the case of General Sherman’s Army, it took most of a day for all\n65,000 to make that last march. In Sherman’s words:\n\n“For six hours and a half that strong tread of the Army of the West\nresounded along Pennsylvania Avenue; not a soul of that vast crowd of\nspectators left his place; and, when the rear of the column had passed\nby, thousands of spectators still lingered to express their confidence\nin the strength of a Government which could claim such an army.”\n\nThe great majority who made this march were not professional soldiers.\nThey were civilians, some ex-slaves, recruited for war. The Army of the\nWest had walked (marched) 2,000 miles–from Vicksburg and the\nMississippi, across Tennessee, then down through Georgia, then up\nthrough South Carolina, North Carolina, Viriginia and finally to their\nCapitol. It had taken them two years.\n\nThis was their last march. They would then be heading home. The\npoignancy of it, the relief and exhilaration of it, the knowledge that a\nterrible Civil War was now over…it all came together in this last\ncombined act of their Army, this march down Pennsylvania Avenue. It was\na parade like no other.\n\nWhen you read Sherman’s remembrance of that day, it makes our present\nsquabbles and national debate seem pale, almost meaningless. What\nsacrifices have we made that can even compare to it? Where would we be\nif slavery were still the law of the land? What if we had two countries,\ninstead of one?\n\nAnd, we think that our nation today is divided and that things are\ncontentious? Compare today to over 600,000 American war dead, families\ndivided by civil war, the blood that was shed, the battle over slavery\non this continent, a war to save the Union…our present problems, in that\ncontext, seem miniscule, just a small footnote in our history.\n\nReading this old history also reminds us that what we enjoy today and\ntake for granted–this democracy we live in–did not come to us by chance.\nIt came through the sacrifice and vision of predecessors. We rise from\nthe shoulders of others.\n\nIt is humbling to remember this. We have so much today, that we tend to\nforget about these early days.\n\nWilliam Tecumseh Sherman was a strong man, a proud man. He did not\n“suffer fools” easily. He could push back and was, sometimes,\nstrong-headed to his detriment. Yet, he knew that without his Army, he\nwould have been nothing. His soldiers called him “Uncle Billy.” I can\nsee Sherman now, standing on the White House reviewing stand, after he\nhad led that parade and then had joined the dignitaries, watching his\ntroops go by, phalanx upon phalanx, and saluting them throughout the\nday. I wish I had been there.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident and a Vietnam veteran.\n\nTop of Form",

      "text": "[homepage logo]\n\n Being On Trump’s Mailing List\n\nLocal Commentaries\n\nOct 5, 2024\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nI just received my fourth mailing from former President Trump asking for\nmoney. This one included a certificate hoping I would join him in a new\n“Lyin’ Kamala Harris and Crooked Joe Biden Target List.”\n\nThis list would be “my badge of courage and honor” which I could frame,\nif I want to, and hang in a prominent place in my home. Of course, the\nname “Trump” is at the top of this list since he says that these two\nDemocrats hate him, and “they hate you, too.”\n\n“The Radicals, Socialists, Communists, and Globalists around them–are\nout to get me because I am fighting for you.” Etc. etc.\n\nHe then urged me to send a contribution suggesting nine different\namounts ranging from $35 to $3,300, and signs it: “God Bless America,\nDonald J. Trump, 45th President of the United States.”\n\nA couple of questions may arise in your mind. First, why would such a\npiece of hate/fear directed mail even be sent to me? The answer to that,\nI believe, is that I have been known to split my ticket when voting and,\non occasion, have contributed to the campaigns of Republicans. Mr. Trump\nmay have misconstrued that into my being a supporter of all Republicans,\nincluding him.\n\nPerhaps this mailing list I am now on came from the fact that in the\npast I had supported our former Congressman, Amo Houghton, a stalwart\nRepublican, who was a good friend and an exceptional Representative for\nthe Southern Tier in the Congress.\n\nIf that is the case, I am sure that Amo must be “turning in his grave.”\nIn my last conversation with him before he died, he was outraged that\nDonald Trump with his divisive rhetoric had taken control of the\nRepublican Party… a political institution which Houghton loved and had\nbeen affiliated with for his whole life.\n\nA second question may be: “When did the Democrats become “radicals,\nsocialists and communists?” The answer is that they aren’t and never\nhave been. These are just made-up words to stir up more disunity and\nfear.\n\nThe only other time in our history which compares to ours currently, in\nmy view, was in the 1840’s and ‘50s. The Whig Party was taken over by\nfear mongers who were warning that immigrants, Catholics, Jews,\nforeigners, etc. were trying to take over the country. Whigs became\nknown as the “Know Nothing Party,” and eventually disappeared from the\nface of our political landscape. A new party was born, the Republican\nParty, opposed to the extension of slavery into the new and expanding\nterritories of the West. This Party, under Lincoln, fought a Civil War\nover the issue. After that, it developed its traditional conservative,\npro-business policies as the nation expanded.\n\nCan that Republican Party again find its roots? Can it again become a\nparty advocating for smaller government, engagement in bi-partisan\nforeign policy (not isolationism,) and in advancing pro-business\npolicies. Can it move away from demanding allegiance to only one person,\nand from the politics of vitriol, personal attacks and target lists?\n\nIn large measure, that is what this current election is all about.\n\nAnd, if you are wondering whether or not I sent in any money to be on\nthis special target list…the answer to that is “not one thin dime.”\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.\n\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form",

There was a lot to see.\n\nA bridge is a bit like an iceberg in that there is much more of it below\nthe road surface than above it. That means that much of the construction\nwork is also more visible underneath, from down below.\n\nWhat hits you immediately from the water level is how massive the\nunder-decking is that was built to protect workers as well as keep\nconstruction debris out of the lake. (It had to be expensive to build.)\nIt hangs below the bridge supported by steel rods from above. It also\nhas lowered the distance from the waterline to the highest arch of the\nbridge from about 42 feet to some 34 feet.\n\nSince this structure is already built, it would be nice if somehow it\ncould be converted into a bikeway/walkway. But, it appears, from its\ndesign, that this is probably not possible.\n\nThe day we were there, jack-up barges were nestled up to a couple of the\nsupporting columns of the bridge and moveable basket cranes (the kind\nthat you see on roof jobs or when painting tall houses) were placed on\ntop of them. Men were in the baskets with airguns cutting out bad\nconcrete soiled by years of wear from salt used to treat the road in the\nwinter.\n\nNew forms had been built in places to replace this old, deteriorated\nconcrete, and one must guess that recent night closures may have been\nrelated to the pouring of new concrete in these areas as well as in\npatching pavement on the open lanes above.\n\nWhat impresses you most from beneath, at the water level, is the\nrealization of just how much human work goes into a bridge repair job of\nthis magnitude. Workers have to do this dirty, physical, hard, manual\nwork. There is no other way that it can be done. My hat goes off to\nthose now working on the bridge.\n\nWhen you look up toward the bridge deck from the water level, you also\nsee what, in the Navy, we called “scuppers”–downspouts that discharge\nrain water, snow melt and the salt that comes with it to the lake below.\n\nThen it hit me that instead of repairing these downspouts–perhaps a\nbikeway/walkway on each side of the bridge could be designed to divert\nthese liquids in the winter. These structures would carry pedestrians\nand bikes in the summer, but, when snow starts falling and the slush\naccumulates, they would catch the plowed snow with the salt and, when it\nmelts, divert it to the shores of the lake to be contained there for\nproper disposal.\n\nCould this improve things environmentally as well as provide public\npedestrian access while, at the same time, reduce corrosion to the\nbridge? (DOT…we may have a win-win possibility here!) At least, it may\nbe something to consider if the Village of Bemus Point is successful in\nreceiving the grant for which it has applied to assess the feasibility\nof such a project.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

Mr. Biden eventually came to the same conclusion and removed\nhimself from the race.\n\nThis week there was another debate, and it was clear, no matter whom you\nfavored, that we now again have a viable campaign underway for this\nhighest office in our land. The contest is now joined.\n\nTo be honest, it would be a stretch to actually call what we saw a\n“debate.” It was more a verbal boxing match than an in-depth analysis of\nissues facing the country. The country knew what to expect from former\nPresident Trump. What we didn’t know is how Vice President Harris would\nhold up under the pressure and scrutiny of it.\n\nI think it is safe to say that, in that respect, she did just fine. She\nwent “toe-to-toe” with the former President. She held her own and let\nhim be himself.\n\nEver since the first televised Presidential debate between Richard Nixon\nand John F. Kennedy, it has become evident that these so-called\n“debates” are really more performance contests than anything else.\nThough issues were debated more thoughtfully in that first debate, the\n“winner,” so called, was deemed to be Mr. Kennedy because he looked\nsharper and more articulate in presenting his views. Mr. Nixon seemed to\nbe tired and not as much at ease as Mr. Kennedy.\n\nIn other words, one candidate performed better than the other.\n\nAnother performance that I remember was that between President Reagan\nand former Vice President Mondale. The press and the pundits had been\nhyping the issue of President Reagan’s age, as compared to the younger\nMr. Mondale. President Reagan put that down with one sentence, promising\nearly in the debate that he “would not make Mr. Mondale’s age an issue\nin this election.” Everyone laughed and after that, Ronald Reagan\ncruised to re-election.\n\nNonetheless, what all of this points to is what I think is really an\nevident weakness in our political system. Every four years, we choose\nour Presidents from a very narrow field–usually, it comes down to only\ntwo people, as to who will lead our executive branch of government.\n\nOne advantage I see in other democracies–like most countries in\nEurope–is that the political leader of the country emerges after many\nyears of serving in a parliament where they can be vetted and evaluated\nby their peers. In our country, you can come out of nowhere with a\nslogan and lot of money, with no political experience, and become\nPresident of the United States.\n\nYet, our system is what it is. The Constitution set it up this way, and\nso every four years we again go through these election campaigns. In\norder to “protect” the process and secure the support of the smaller\nstates, the Constitutional Convention also set up the mechanism of the\nElectoral College. Though this seems archaic today and can allow a\ncandidate with fewer popular votes win the Presidency– unless changed by\nconstitutional amendment (which is not easy,) the Electoral College will\nlikely be with us for many years to come.\n\nSo–the campaign has now begun with all the hoopla and political\nadvertising that goes with it.

It is\nprobably the third or fourth time, and each time I find new “nuggets” of\nwhat made this man “tick.”\n\nPresident Lincoln worked with a lot of Generals during the war. Most of\nthem could recognize risk, but many of them were unwilling to act on it.\nGeneral McClellan was probably the most well-known of this type.\n\nAs Lincoln looked over the entire panoply of Generals in the Army, it\nwas the younger, less conspicuous, less voluble man in the West who kept\n“popping up” and who ultimately captured Lincoln’s attention–Ulysses S.\nGrant.\n\nGrant’s first great battle was at Shiloh in 1862. His Army ran straight\ninto a Confederate Army along the Tennessee/Mississippi border. Grant\nput his whole Army at risk, and after a two-day slugfest with thousands\nof casualties and, at times, the outcome uncertain–the Confederate Army\nwithdrew from the field.\n\nGrant’s next great victory came in 1863 at Vicksburg, a place he\nsurrounded by taking the risk of moving his troops down the west side of\nthe Mississippi River, then crossing them below Vicksburg and finally\nattacking the city from its South and East. It was unexpected and risky,\nbut Vicksburg finally surrendered.\n\nYet, it was his action, later that same year at Chattanooga that finally\npropelled Grant to becoming the General of all of the Union’s Armies. In\nOctober 1863, the Union forces at Chattanooga were virtually surrounded\nand were starving. The Secretary of War and the President were worried\nthat they could collapse and sent in Grant.\n\nGrant got to Chattanooga late in the month, traversing by horseback a\nmountainous trail covered with thousands of corpses of dead horses and\nmules who had already perished from lack of fodder. It wasn’t a\npromising picture, and the Army itself needed food.\n\nWithin a week, Grant had decided on a different route to bring in food\nand supplies by pushing through Confederate Territory and coming up from\nthe southwest over a shorter distance. By using the Tennessee River,\nthen cutting cross-country to the same River and building a bridge at\nBrown’s Ferry near Chattanooga– supplies for the Army started coming in.\nThe troops called it the “Cracker Line,” as it brought them crackers\n(and food) that they hadn’t seen for weeks.\n\nThe decision was risky, but Grant acted. A starving Army can’t fight.\n\nThe terrain around Chattanooga is rough and mountainous…you may have\ndriven through it on I-75 if you have gone that way to Atlanta.\nConfederate forces held most of the high ground. But, by mid-November,\nGrant had moved thousands of new troops over the same “Cracker Line,”\nprimarily at night to avoid their discovery. On November 24th, over a\n10-mile-long line, 60,000 Union troops attacked simultaneously taking\nMissionary Ridge, the valleys east and south of Chattanooga, and\nultimately Lookout Mountain itself.\n\nDuring this same time, Grant was under tremendous pressure from\nWashington to rush to the aid of General Burnside in Knoxville to the\nnorth. Yet, he withstood that pressure until Chattanooga was secure,\nthen sent General Sherman’s troops north to relieve Knoxville. After\nthat, most of Tennessee was under the control of the Union.\n\nIt was clear, after Chattanooga, that Grant was the man who would assess\nrisk and then act on it. Within 4 months of the victory in Chattanooga,\nLincoln would bring him to Washington and Virginia to become General of\nall Union Armies. Thousands would still die in our Civil War, but its\noutcome was now assured.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

I am not sure there is a\nway to describe what it means, other than it conveys the idea that\n“things have changed” or “the situation is now reversed.”\n\nHowever it is used, it seems to describe what has now happened in our\nnational politics. The Republicans, who seemed to be unbeatable in the\nPresidential race after the disastrous showing of President Biden in the\nJune debate–now seem to be scrambling to regain their traction after\nBiden’s announcement that he was dropping out of the race.\n\n“The shoe is on the other foot.” Kamala Harris is now the Democratic\nnominee for President.\n\nThis does not mean that she will carry Chautauqua County. Our default\npolitics around here are Republican. However, in “toss-up” areas of the\ncountry, she has brought new energy to the race and the Democrats now\nseem to have a fighting chance.\n\nOne change that I have noticed around here is that some Republicans have\nexpressed worry and are now urging Donald Trump to talk about policy–the\ninference being that he tends to talk more about himself than about the\nissues facing the country.\n\nMy own view is that the election is still Mr. Trump’s to lose. He had a\nbig “head of steam” going into this election, and the electorate is\nstill concerned about inflation and the economy. That, automatically,\nputs those governing in potential jeopardy at the polls.\n\nYet, it is not beyond the realm of possibility, that Harris could pull\nthis off and become the first woman ever elected to be President of the\nUnited States. That possibility scares the pants off some but is a point\nof great anticipation and rejoicing for others.\n\nTo be honest, I was hoping that Harris would name Governor Andy Beshear\nof Kentucky as her running mate. Yet, her decision to choose Governor\nTim Walz still brings geographic and political balance to the ticket.\nWalz, aside from being a Governor, also has military experience, was a\nCongressman for 10 years, and coached high school football–all of which\nmay have “tipped the scales” in his favor.\n\nHowever the election turns out, it was good for the country that Joe\nBiden decided not to run for re-election. As I wrote in this column\nafter the disastrous debate–because of obvious age-related issues, it\nwas clear that he was no longer able to carry on an effective national\ncampaign for the Presidency. Except for unanimously electing George\nWashington, we have always had a vigorous and articulated debate between\nat least two viable contenders for this highest office in our land.\n\nRecently, friends from Germany were visiting, and it was revealing to\nget their European “take” on our Presidential elections. Germany, like\nvirtually all countries in Europe, has a parliamentary form of\ngovernment where the Prime Minister becomes leader only after many years\nof political experience as a legislator. In contrast, our campaigns for\nthe Presidency seem, to them, more a personality contest than a\ndiscussion on matters of government.\n\nHowever you view it, we are now right in the middle of another\nPresidential election. The people, through our electoral college system,\nwill, in another three months, decide who will lead our nation over the\nnext four years. That has been the American way for over 200 years.\n\nRolland Kidder is a Stow resident.",

      "text": "Awaiting the Decision of the Electorate\n\nIt is the day before the election as I am writing this, and I have just\nfinished reading a newspaper article full of advice from a psychiatrist\nabout how to deal with election angst—the anxiety of waiting for\nelection results.\n\nIf the average person feels this way, just think of what it must be for\nthe candidates. They are the ones who have put their name on the line\nand have submitted themselves to the will of the electorate.\n\nI still vividly remember my own personal experience, one day, of going\nthrough this. It was 1970. I had just returned from Vietnam, had won a\nprimary election while overseas, but now—after a long, hard-fought\ngeneral election campaign—was awaiting the decision of the voters. It\nwas a long day, and, at the end of it, the voters said: “ ‘No,’ you will\nnot be going to Albany.”\n\nStan Lundine was Mayor of Jamestown then, and, as the final returns came\nin at Democratic election headquarters, he came over to me and said:\n“Sorry, about the result. You ran a good campaign. Come with me. We are\ngoing to pay a visit.”\n\n“Where?” I asked. “We are going down to the Liberty AC Club where the\nRepublicans are having a victory party so that you can congratulate Jack\nBeckman on his re-election to the Assembly.”\n\nAnd, so we did. It wasn’t much fun, and we didn’t stick around long to\ncelebrate with them. But, it was the right thing to do. Elections have\nan end. It is not your job you are running for. It belongs to the\npeople, to the electorate. They make that decision. It is not yours to\nmake.\n\nEventually, four years later, I won that seat and was elected to the\nAssembly. But, I will never forget the lesson I learned that night in\n1970. The people who would decide my fate did so at the ballot box. That\nis the American way.\n\nEver since then, I have always been at “loose ends” on election days.\nThough I am no longer a candidate, I can feel the angst and, in a sense,\nthe loneliness of those running for office. As a candidate, you believe\nthat you are the best person for the job, or you wouldn’t be running.\nYet, the decision of whether or not you get the job will be a decision\nmade by others.\n\nWhether you are running for something like the Presidency of the United\nStates or a seat on the Town Board—election day is always a long day.\nYou have done everything that you can. There is no time left. The people\nare in the voting booth, and they will decide your fate.\n\nThere is a sense of vulnerability when you are a candidate. There is\ngreat joy if you win, and it is a real downer if you lose.\n\nThe silver lining in the cloud is that you have been part of a process\nunderway in this country since its founding that has been fundamental to\nour democracy—free and fair elections.\n\nDemocracies require candidates for office as well as voters. When the\nelections are over, win or lose, we congratulate the victor—that too is\nthe American way.\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Canaries In A Coal Mine—The Trigger That Ended World War II\n\nWars are easy to start but notoriously difficult to end. That was the\ncase in World War II. Though the Emperor of Japan had announced on\nAugust 15, 1945 that Japan was surrendering, there were well-founded\ndoubts about whether the country could or would surrender.\n\nOne must remember than throughout all of the horrific battlegrounds of\nthe Pacific, the Japanese had been ordered to die to the last man for\nthe Emperor...and most had. The American casualties on places like\nOkinawa and Iwo Jima were horrific, but he vast majority of Japanese\nthere had been killed...they would not surrender.\n\nNow, with one message could all of this be turned around? Would the\nsurrender hold? Not only were Americans worried, but one must assume\nthat the Emperor himself was concerned.\n\nThe Japanese cabinet had been split on ending the war. Three Naval\nOfficers in the Japanese cabinet had sided with the Emperor on ____\nAugust, to end the war. The three Army representatives in the cabinet\nhad voted to continue the war. The Emperor broke the deadlock...the war\nwas to end.\n\nOn _____August, there had been an attempted coup at the Imperial Palace\nto stop the public announcement of the Emperor’s decision. Now that\nsurrender had been announced, would the surrender hold? Would the\nJapanese military and Japanese people honor it?\n\nIn reading histories and books written about this time, I have always\nbeen struck by the dearth of information dealing with the internal\nturmoil of the last two weeks of World War II—that time between the\nEmperor’s announcement on August 15, 1945 and the formal surrender of\nthe Japanese on September 2, 1945.\n\nHistories seem to jump from the Japanese announcement of surrender to\nGeneral MacArthur’s big show on the deck of the Battleship Missouri in\nTokyo Bay...as if it were a foregone conclusion.\n\nYet, apprehension on both sides and logic itself would require that\nsomehow there had to be a test as to the viability of the upcoming\nsurrender and occupation of Japan. The United States was not going to\nsend its senior five star general, Douglas MacArthur, into defeated\nJapan unless there was some assurance that the surrender was real.\n\nMacArthur wrote in his official history of the occupation of Japan that\n“the first American troops arrived in Japan on _______. They may have\nbeen the first American Army troops that entered the country, but others\nhad preceded them—Americans, likely mostly Navy men were landed in three\nlocations to “test the waters”, so-to-speak. From an analysis of radio\nmessaging, it seems that this happened either on the evening of August\n21, 1945 or early in the morning on the 22^(nd) of August,1945.\n\nThose who landed were essentiallly “canaries in a coal mine,” whose life\nor death would determine if Japan was ready to surrender. They\napparently all survived, though their story has never been told. Their\nbravery and role in starting the actual surrender of Japan were quietly\nand cryptically announced by Admiral William “Bull” Halsey, Commander of\nthe Third Fleet who was ,by then, actively coordinating then naval\nforces around Japan with General MacArthur—who, by that time, who was\nrunning the upcoming occupation of Japan end from his headquarters in\nManila.\n\nIn a Top Secret message dated 21 August 1945 at 2327- Z (Greenwich Mean\nTime)...or 0827 in the morning on August 22^(nd) Japan time, Halsey\nwrote this activating the formal Operations Order directing the\nsurrender and occupation of Japan:\n\n“Japan has surrendered. Army forces have seized ATSUGI airfield, and\nCINCAFPAC\n\nAdvance Headquarters are established there. CTF 31 forces hold YOKOSUKA",

How could this be?\n\nDonald Trump may want a ballroom added to the White House, but the White\nHouse is not Mar-a-Lago.

Sometimes, it was not an easy process,\nbut through it, the Memorial became better and more fitting for its\nsurroundings.\n\nSome might call this “big government.” But, what we have now in\nWashington seems to be “bigger government.” You can demolish the East\nWing of the White House, buy $ 9 billion of stock in the Intel\nCorporation, or buy $30 billion dollars of Argentine pesos to prop up a\nSouth American country...and there is nary a whisper.\n\nCongress is on vacation, the Supreme Court is mute and the country\nstands by impotently and watches the White House morph into Mar-a-Lago.\nThis is wrong.

At one time, this\nutility was paying a great portion of the total tax levy in Dunkirk. A\ngradual reduction over several years in those taxes was a part of the\nshutdown of the plant. Everyone knew that these tax subsidies would come\nto an end...there was time to prepare.\n\nIn the case of Fredonia, what I have heard most about are the costs they\nare facing with an old water system and a sewer plant that needs\nsignificant upgrades. Again, these are issues that didn’t just start\nhappening overnight. But, apparently, addressing the issues was put off.\n\nMy experience in being involved in and observing government over the\nyears is that it is much easier to add programs, people and services\nthan it is to reduce them. Yet, at some point, when “push comes to\nshove,” government spending must be aligned with the ability of those\nwho are paying the bill.\n\nI was in the state legislature in the mid-1970’s when the City of New\nYork was on the verge of bankruptcy. The City had to cut back on\nspending, and a new Mayor was elected, Ed Koch, who went about doing\nthat. I always respected Koch for being a strong Mayor and being willing\nto say “No” to many of the entrenched interests living off the City of\nNew York. Ultimately, New York City had to learn to live within its\nmeans.\n\nAs to the future here, being a “Monday morning quarterback,” contributes\nlittle, if anything, to the conversation. Dwelling on the past is not a\nsolution.\n\nWhat is needed is for the public to encourage those who are now trying\nto deal with the fiscal problems in our communities...even if this means\ncutting back or combining some services.\n\nThe “chickens have come home to roost,” and now is the time for elected\nofficials to make the tough decisions necessary to correct things... and\nfor the public to support such actions.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "War Department Not a Good Idea\n\nOur President announced recently that we should rename the Defense\nDepartment, the “War Department” because we have not been winning enough\nwars. That is a bad idea.\n\nMaybe it was an idea that came from some of the “issue for the day”\npeople that he has surrounded himself with, i.e. it didn’t originate\nfrom him. But, still, war is not something that we should be embracing,\npromoting or touting in any manner.\n\nCongress and the courts should just let the Defense Department remain\nthe “Defense” Department. Let the President sign all of the Executive\nOrders that he wants to...but let’s not go back to the “War” Department.\n\nI have often thought, though it may be just happenstance, that Robert H.\nJackson may have influenced the renaming of the old War Department as\nthe new “Defense Department” back in 1947. Remember, he had just gone\nthrough the major trial of Nazi defendants at Nuremberg.\n\nOne of Jackson’s observations coming out of that experience is engraved\non the flagpole base at the Robert Jackson Center here in town. It says:\n“If we can root out of men’s thinking that all wars are legal... at last\nwe will have mobilized the forces of law on the side of peace.”\n\nThe last thing we need to do to promote peace in the world is to go back\nto the idea that war is inevitable and legitimate. Yes, we do have a\nright to defend ourselves as a nation...but that gives us no right to\nframe “war” as an objective by giving it the priority of departmental\nstatus in our government.\n\nAdmittedly, the name change to Defense Department came out of a\nlong-needed reorganization of our military services... an evaluation\nsparked in many ways by our experience in the Second World War. There\nhad been serious divisions during that conflict between the Army and the\nNavy, and there was also a perceived need to create the Air Force as a\nseparate service. Better coordination was needed. That reorganization\nalso gave impetus to creating a department of “defense” and not “war.”\n\nIn the United States, a strong defense has always been framed as a way\nto avoid war, not to promote it.\n\nI know something about war, having actually been in one and in combat.\nIt is not something anyone should want.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I am assuming that the idea of creating a War\nDepartment was not a serious proposal, but just something to get people\nlike me riled up. I know that you had a falling out with both General\n“Mad Dog” Mattis and General Kelly in your first administration, both of\nwhom had distinguished careers in the Marine Corps. But on something as\nconsequential as renaming the Pentagon as the home of “war” instead of\n“defense,”—perhaps you should pull them back into your orbit one more\ntime and ask them what they might think of such an idea.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nVietnam Veteran",

Though neither\nnow live in Queens, this is the place where they “cut their eye teeth”\nwhen it came to business and politics.\n\nHaving spent a few years in Albany (now many years ago,) I had a “bird’s\neye view” of politicians from across the state. Queens was known then as\na scrappy place where people grew up battling, in one form or another,\nfor everything from political turf to business advantage.\n\nLife there seemed to be right out of Darwin, where competition was\nrampant and only the strong survived. And... survive they have!\n\nDonald Trump won the Presidency and then lost it, and then regained it\nagain, despite some sexual improprieties that in court judgments have\ncost him a lot of money. Andrew Cuomo won the Governorship of New York\nonly to lose it in a sexual harassment scandal (which he has never\nadmitted to,) and now seems poised to re-enter politics as Mayor of the\nCity of New York as front-runner in the primary election being held\nthere next week.\n\nI guess that you could describe the political style of these two men as\n“in your face politics.” Always be on the offensive, keep changing the\nnarrative, keep your name in the headlines, never admit guilt or\nwrongdoing, and you will ultimately be rewarded with success.\n\nWhat they also seem to have in common is a “top down” approach to\ngoverning. They both act as though they are smarter than everyone else\nin the room, and they will tell you how things are going to go down.\nThey are also known for making promises that are hollow and unfulfilled.\n\nWhen running for Governor, Andrew Cuomo promised to appoint a special\nTask Force on Natural Gas Drilling in the Southern Tier and abide by\ntheir recommendation. Once elected, he called his then brother-in-law,\nBobby Kennedy Jr., about the issue. Kennedy was anti-fracking and\nanti-natural gas—so Cuomo ignored his promise and his commission’s\nrecommendation and shut down natural gas drilling in the state. That\nmoratorium is still in effect though millions in the state depend upon\nnatural gas to heat their homes.\n\nSimilarly, Donald Trump, promised that he could solve the\nUkraine/Russian War in 24 hours if elected President. He made a similar\npromise that he would solve Israel’s war with Gaza. Both promises are\nstill unfulfilled.\n\nPromises are made not to be kept, but to win elections. That all comes\nfrom the hard-scrabble lessons learned in Queens.\n\nIt is interesting how politics seems to have been “turned on its head”\nnow as one former Governor from Queens is poised to be elected Mayor of\nthe City of New York, primarily because it is expected that he will be\nthe strongest and toughest in challenging another man from Queens who\nsits again in the Oval Office.\n\nYet, it could be that these two guys will get along. Their style of\ngoverning is the same, and they have a common bond with Bobby Kennedy\nJr. who is now in the cabinet.\n\nHowever, it works out between Cuomo and Trump...the Borough of Queens\nshould be a winner.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nUpstate New Yorker",

      "text": "Thus Far, A Quiet Election\n\nThis is an “off year” in politics. There are no elections for federal\noffice. That comes next year when there will be elections for Congress.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that the elections this year are unimportant. Who we\nelect for County Executive, the County Legislature and other local\noffices is still important. Local elections give us the opportunity to\nchoose elected officials who are the closest to us, and who operate most\nof the government that we deal with on a daily basis.\n\nSome don’t like them, but I am a big believer in political campaign\nsigns. They remind us of our obligation to participate in government.\n\nThis year, I have seen signs for the Republican candidate for County\nExecutive but none, so far, for the Democrat who is running. If the\nelection were held today, I doubt that many people would even be aware\nthat a race is going on for this position. That is sad, as County\nExecutive is an office that we should be interested in.\n\nThere is also an election this year for County Clerk, and I have seen\nsigns for both the Republican and Democratic candidates. This is a\nlesser-known office, but the County Clerk has the important obligation\nof filing deeds and other instruments at the courthouse. In addition,\nthe Clerk runs the Bureau of Motor Vehicles and administers its various\noffices in the county. The general public probably has more contact with\nthe DMV than with any other government office.\n\nI have also seen political signs for County Legislative races, though\nthere are several districts in which there is not a political contest.\n\nWhen there is no contest for a political office, it makes for a “real\nquiet” election. That may be good for the only candidate running, but it\ndoes not leave a choice for the voter...which is what elections are all\nabout.\n\nThat brings up the subject of the health of our election system as a\nwhole. Sadly, I believe, it is harder than ever to get people to run for\noffice. Elected office can be a “thankless” job. It takes time to go to\nmeetings, pass resolutions, laws, budgets and do all of the other things\nrequired for the functioning of government.\n\nYet, at its core, there is nothing more important in our corporate life\nas citizens than elections. It is essential that we have people running\nfor public office. That should be part of our DNA as Americans.\n\nThe bottom line, I guess, is that I just don’t like “quiet” elections. I\nwant to hear the candidates, listen to the issues being debated, be\ninvigorated with all of the “hoopla” surrounding the whole process, and\nthen participate as a voter in actually choosing who our political\nleaders will be.\n\nWe need to stay involved in our government, lest we lose it. There is no\nsubstitute for elections. I commend those who are running...I just wish\nthat there were more citizens willing to become candidates for public\noffice.\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

If I were in his\ninner circle, I would advise him that this is an honor for which you are\nchosen—not one you lobby or campaign for.\n\nBut, that aside, if he can pull off a solution to the current\nIsraeli/Gazan War, perhaps he should be so honored.\n\nAs the columnist Thomas Friedman recently wrote: “If Donald Trump is\nable to secure a cease-fire, Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, return of\nIsraeli hostages, and it holds and paves the way for negotiations on the\nonly solution of two states for two people...Trump will not only deserve\nthe Nobel Peace Prize, he’ll deserve the Nobel Prize in Physics and\nChemistry as well. Because that would be quite an achievement.”\n\nI have not been a fan of Donald Trump’s top-down approach to governing\nnor of many of his policies—but, I too am hoping that he can find a way\nout of this terrible war in which Hamas killed some 2,000 Israelis, and\nwhere Israel has killed some 60,000 Palestinians in response.\n\nPresident Trump is in a unique position to end this conflict. First, and\nforemost, in being as close as he is to Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s\nleader, Trump essentially coopted him, pushing Netanyahu into accepting\na ceasefire and bringing the war to an end.\n\nTrump also has deep roots and connections to the Arab countries of the\nMiddle East, not just as President but through his family and business\nconnections with countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. These nations\nmet in Egypt with the United States and hammered out a deal to end the\nIsraeli-Gazan War. Great Britain and France were also supporting the\neffort. It was not just the United States that was involved.\n\nAny resolution from the carnage of Gaza to Israel’s exhaustion and\ndiminishment resulting from this war, will require support from Arab\nnations in the region. Meetings are continuing in Egypt with several\ncountries now involved including representatives from the United\nNations.\n\nSo, Mr. President, I give you credit for getting the parties to the\ntable, and, as an American, I am hoping that your efforts can lead to a\npermanent peace in the area.\n\nMy only advice would be that you keep after the effort. It will take\ntime. This is no “slam-dunk,” quick-and-its-over situation. The\ndivisions and hatreds in this part of the world run deep, so whatever\nsolution is arrived at must have staying power and will require a\nlong-term commitment. Wars are easy to start, but difficult to end.\n\nFriedman addressed this same issue with a question: “Will the Trump\nadministration have the attention, the energy and the focus that’ll be\nrequired every day to keep such a complicated solution on track?” “I\nhope so,” he concludes.\n\nI hope so too. If President Trump can stop this war, keep it stopped,\nstart a new and responsible governance for Palestine, and keep Israel\nwithin its borders...maybe he will be recognized for his work by the\nNobel Committees in Norway and Sweden.\n\nIt may seem unlikely that a President who has created a Department of\nWar instead of Defense would receive a Peace Prize, but stranger things\nhave been known to have happened down through the course of human\nhistory.\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

These French words refer to team spirit,\nto people respecting each other and working together for a common\npurpose.\n\nThe construction workers on this job work as a team without a lot of\nshouting or being “bossed” around. They just do their jobs and expect\nthose around them to do the same. It is obvious that they respect each\nother and like their jobs.\n\nOne may be on a backhoe, another laying out the route of pipe for the\nnext day, another restoring areas disturbed as the new sewer system is\ninstalled—but their effort is quite seamless. It is inspiring to watch.\n\nIn looking back at my own life experience, it made me recall my first\nduty assignment as a new Ensign in the U.S. Navy back in 1967. I was\nassigned to be the Operations Officer on a small ship homebased in\nSasebo, Japan.\n\nIt truly was a small ship by Navy standards...60 men with 6 officers\nwere its contingent. In reflection, though, what really made its\nsmallness significant is that we usually operated alone, not in the\ncompany of other ships.\n\nOur mission required us to work with other allied Navies in that part of\nthe world, so we would travel to places like South Korea, the\nPhilippines, Vietnam, etc. to do our work...and we would travel alone.\n\nWe didn’t think much about it then, but the fact that we could travel\nsuch long distances without significant help close by was a testament to\nthe commitment of members of the crew to each other and to our\ndependence upon each other. People knew their jobs, respected each\nother, and trusted in one another.\n\nHere I was...a greenhorn, boot Ensign right out of Officer Candidate\nSchool and while underway was assigned as an Officer of the Deck on the\nbridge responsible for the safety and movements of the ship for four\nhours at a time, often in the middle of the night. But, it wasn’t just\nme up there on the bridge, there was a duty section consisting of one\nthird of the crew up and working at the same time all over the ship\ndoing their jobs. We were a team. There was an “esprit de corps” in what\nwe were doing.\n\nI remember one time on that ship when we were caught in what were close\nto typhoon-force winds while enroute from Taiwan back to our homebase in\nJapan. The seas were so high that they had the power to roll the ship\nover. We had to keep the bow of the ship into the oncoming waves to\navoid this.\n\nThe bridge was about 25 ft. above the waterline, and the waves were\nabout 30 ft. in height. Sometimes, for a second or two, the sea would\nsweep over the bow, and then we would lurch up with the bow nearly out\nof the water as the ship headed over the crest and then pitched down\ninto the following trough as the next wave approached. It went on like\nthis for about two days.\n\nIt wasn’t much fun, but we were not alarmed. Everyone was doing their\njob as a team to ensure that the ship got through.\n\nIt only takes about one such time in your life going through something\nlike this to make you realize that your life is dependent upon the lives\nand work of others. “Esprit De Corps” is real. It is necessary. It is\nwhat makes the world work, and we need more of it.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

Yet, what makes it so immense is that it is like seeing ten or\ntwelve such buildings all tied together. The size of it dominates the\nhorizon.\n\nI can remember only two other public work projects in Western New York\nthan can even compare with it—one being the completion of the New York\nState Thruway in 1960 and the other, at about the same time, the\nbuilding and completion of the Niagara Power Project in Niagara Falls.\n\nYet those projects did not have the visual impact of the new Bills\nstadium. The Thruway was a linear roadway, and you didn’t sense its\npresence much until you drove on it.\n\nThe Niagara Power Project was built mostly underground carrying water\nfrom above the first rapids to below the last rapids of the Niagara\nRiver through two large 60 ft. diameter buried conduits thus doubling\nthe height (or head) of falling water of prior power plants which had\nbeen built right at the base of the falls. Though having great impact,\nbeing built largely below ground, the Power Project is next to invisible\nas you travel through our area.\n\nNot so with the new Bills stadium. It stands out like the Statue of\nLiberty in New York Harbor. It is going to be a new “marker” for Western\nNew York.\n\nI remember back to the days when Ralph Wilson paid a pittance for this\nfootball team, and they were playing their games at the old “Rock Pile”\nStadium in Buffalo. I went to some of those games. Then came the big\ndecision to move the Bills to the suburbs at One Bills Drive, their\ncurrent stadium. Here the Bills became the beloved and integral part of\nWestern New York that we now know.\n\nYet, I may still live long enough to see them playing in another brand\nnew stadium in Orchard Park, this one costing $1.5 billion. Who would\nhave “thunk” it?\n\nI have to give credit to Terry Pegula, owner of the Bills and formerly\nfrom Olean, who stepped up to the plate to make it happen. I, for one,\nalso commend the Governor and the State of New York for pitching in.\nWestern New York, on its own, did not have the means or where-with-all\nto get it done. It took a commitment from the State of New York. It also\ndidn’t hurt that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, born in Jamestown, also\nwanted the new stadium.\n\nThe Bills are still the only team in the NFL homeported in New York. The\nJets and the Giants play their games in New Jersey.\n\nWhen it comes to economic development and growing Western New York, I\nbelieve that the new Bills Stadium will be of significant help. When\npeople come to this area looking for a job or a new home, after seeing\nNiagara Falls, they are going to say: “Now, take me to that new Bills\nStadium!”\n\nEven if you don’t like football, you must admit that having an NFL team\nin a small-market town like Buffalo is a significant “feather in our\ncap.” Will we ever make it to the Super Bowl? Who knows? But, on we\ngo...Go Bills!\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "The Ice Fishermen Are Back!\n\nThe other day, late in the afternoon, the dogs exploded with barking.\nUsually, that happens when an unfamiliar delivery truck comes down the\ndriveway. This time, it was the almost predictable annual arrival of a\ngood friend who had come to park his pickup truck and then walk out to\ntest the thickness of the ice.\n\nSure enough, he walked a couple of hundred yards offshore, put a drill\nbit to work through the ice, and a good solid 3 or 4 inches of ice core\nwas revealed. It was time to fish!\n\nHe was back about an hour later, just at dusk, with a old ice-fishing\npal... and soon their tent was up, a good fishing hole had been bored\nthrough the ice, and the fishing began.\n\nI didn’t see him come off the ice that night, but expect that he\nprobably had a couple of good-sized walleye with him when he headed for\nhome.\n\nI know that he also fishes in the summer, when the lake is open water.\nBut, there is nothing like the intensity, challenge and outdoor\nexperience of ice fishing.\n\nYet, I must admit, that it is something I have never done. I observe it\nevery year, but have no interest in bundling up in layers of warm\nclothing topped with a hood and knit hat and sitting out on a frozen\nlake waiting for the fish to bite.\n\nThat takes a special person, and it is not me.\n\nInterestingly, the next morning, a Saturday, when I went, as usual, at\n6:30 a.m. to Hogan’s Hut to get the newspaper, there were pickup trucks\nand fishermen everywhere buying everything from bait, to fishing tackle,\nto breakfast sandwiches. The word was out...the lake was open for ice\nfishing!\n\nOf course, what the whole experience reveals again is the overwhelming\nappeal of Chautauqua Lake as a fishing resource and outdoor sporting\ndestination. It has always amazed me how this highly-used lake continues\nto be such an excellent fishery...even in the heart of winter.\n\nIt looks now like we could be at the start of an “old-fashioned” winter.\nWe have had a lot of snow—the Village of Mayville website says 89 inches\nso far, and more cold and snow is expected. We have already seen\nsnowmobiles zipping down the frozen lake... another outdoor “magnet” for\nthose who enjoy winter.\n\nWhen they come, the snowmobilers give way to the ice fishermen, who have\nbeen there first and staked out their claim to what the lake can give.\nThere really isn’t any law, that I know of, regulating this—there is\njust mutual respect between the ice fishermen and snowmobile riders that\nthey both can enjoy what the ice brings.\n\nAnd, for those of you who, like me, enjoy a warm fire instead of ice\nfishing—I would only suggest that you take a drive around the lake some\nsunny, cold day and look at what is going on. It is beautiful out there\non the lake...even in the dead of winter!\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

That local school kids\ncan put on such an exceptional performance combined with all of the\nchoreography and building of stage sets—is a great testament to our\nsystem of public education.\n\nAs a grandparent of kids so involved, it makes me not a disinterested\nobserver. When I go to one of these performances, I am all in! I keep my\nhandkerchief close by as I know that at some point in the performance, I\nam going to tear up.\n\nOne aspect of it all is that “musicals,” as we know them, are primarily\nan American phenomenon. They are a Broadway thing. People from all over\nthe world come to New York every year just to experience the latest\nAmerican musical.\n\nYou never know what the Broadway crowd is going to cook up. I was\nespecially impressed a few years back when the musical “Hamilton” came\nout. I thought it would be a flop. How could anyone make a conservative\n“straight arrow” banker like Alexander Hamilton into a Broadway star?\nBut they did it! It has been one of the biggest hits ever.\n\nFor the student participants in these local school musicals, the whole\nexperience has to be unforgettable. Our grandson explained it this way:\n\n“When we first started rehearsing, nobody knew anything about the play,\nhad never heard most of the songs, and many of us had never done a dance\nroutine. We thought we could never pull it off. Then, one day, it hit\nus—we realized that we actually could do it. Then it all came together.”\n\nAnd did it ever! The standing ovation at the end, said it all.\nHandkerchiefs throughout the crowd came out of pockets. You would have\nthought it was Broadway itself.\n\nOf course, the unheralded hero in the whole show was the\nteacher/director who had taken this raw material of untested talent and\nmolded it all into a show. The choreography, the beauty of the stage\nset, the lighting, the musical accompaniment, the singing—without a\ndirector, it wouldn’t have happened.\n\nThe “Americanness” of it all also hit me. Here we were, in a public\nschool, in an audience coming from all different directions and\noutlooks, cheering and appreciating what these kids were doing. It was\nbeautiful. You don’t find this happening in many foreign countries.\n\nSometimes, I find the storyline in these musicals to be a bit hoaky and\nsyrupy. But that doesn’t matter. The power of music combined with a\nplay—outside of opera, there is nothing that compares to it.\n\nKudos to our schools, kids, teachers, and parents for sponsoring again\nthe Great American Musical!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "The Challenge of Neighborhood Renewal\n\nA friend recently dropped off a book about Jamestown’s “Lost\nNeighborhood,” the old Italian-American neighborhood that was located\nalong the Chadakoin River adjacent to Harrison Street. I remember this\nneighborhood well, as I used to trek through it when walking to or from\nJamestown High School.\n\n“Twenty-twenty” hindsight often resolves nothing, so I tread lightly\nwhen I say that “it would have been better had Brooklyn Square been\nrebuilt without destroying this community.” But, it was done. Can we\nlearn from the experience?\n\nIt has been my view, over the years, that the old industrial and\ncommercial buildings that constituted much of the area of Brooklyn\nSquare, were likely beyond repair and the City needed to remove them,\nstart over, and reopen the river so it could be seen again. But, what\nwas gained by taking down the small homes around Derby Street, an\nimportant residential ethnic neighborhood?\n\nAdmittedly, the time of the late 1960’s and early 1970’s were “heady\nones” when it came to urban planning. Most of the cities of the nation\nwere getting old, so a national urban renewal program was initiated. It\naffected communities across the country, including Jamestown.\n\nThat whole era makes me think of today… of neighborhoods today, of what\nwe are doing to insure their future. It is not just a matter of what is\nhappening in the cities. Neighborhoods happen in villages, in suburban\ncommunities and even in the country.\n\nI have grandchildren growing up in these neighborhoods. They are making\nfriends, going to school, playing sports and making life-long friends.\nWe all should be thinking and hoping that 20 years from now, these will\nbe places for them to return to, to repeat the experience.\n\nWe usually hear more about housing demolitions than replacement or new\nhousing. Housing, especially in the cities, is a challenge because the\nlots there are often small. Because of that, any new or replacement\nhousing likely needs to be built on a smaller footprint. Yet, it may\nalso be possible to replace houses by combining lots…thus enabling\none-story, handicapped accessible housing to be built.\n\nI mention this latter approach, as older people (like me) need to have\nthings on one floor. Climbing stairs is not a good option. Most\ntwo-story houses around here have a kitchen and living area on the first\nfloor…but the bedrooms and bath are upstairs.\n\nHopefully, city fathers and the housing people in places like Albany and\nWashington, also realize this. Keeping elderly citizens in their homes\ncan help keep neighborhoods together. The City of Jamestown recently\nannounced a pilot program to make the renovation of existing housing\nmore affordable. We will have to wait and see how that develops.\n\nOf course, good schools also help stabilize neighborhoods. There is a\nlot that goes into it. The beauty and stability of growing up in a good\nneighborhood is of irreplaceable value. We need to keep figuring out how\nto keep doing it.\n\nThis is what will keep our kids and their kids coming back here to live.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

Yet,\nconcrete removal, in general, seems to have slowed. The focus now seems\nto be on making repairs below, chipping away bad concrete spots and\nreplacing that with new cement.\n\nThe bigger challenge of removing concrete on the arched (or belly)\nsection of the bridge, at least, for now, has not begun. It is now\nAugust, so thought must be going into how winter will affect\nconstruction and traffic on the bridge. The current open lanes seem to\nbe quite narrow. Will the snow-plow trucks be able to get through? We\nmust assume that the DOT has a winter plan for snow removal in mind.\n\nAs to the idea of including a bikeway/walkway as a part of the project,\nthe Village of Bemus Point, supported by other local governments, the\nCounty Executive, and several non-profit groups--has submitted a grant\napplication to study this feasibility with the Federal Highway\nAdministration (FHWA.) We now must await a decision on that request from\nWashington.\n\nAs to other issues around the lake, kudos to the County Legislature for\nmoving ahead on a feasibility study to complete sewers around the lake.\nIf that can be done, then the whole lake, including Dewittville to just\nnorth of the Midway Park area, will have public sewers.\n\nResearch on aquatic issues facing the lake continues to advance with\nmore sensing devices being installed to monitor water quality.\n\nPerhaps the biggest announcement in terms of water quality came recently\nfrom the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In co-operation with Chautauqua\nCounty Government, the Army Corps is undertaking a massive study on the\nimpact of harmful algae in the lake, and what might be possible actions\nto address that problem.\n\nWhat has engaged lake homeowners the most this summer has been the\nthreat, or purported threat, posed by the New York State DEC in making\nnew wetland maps. Signs have popped up all over saying “Keep the Lake, a\nLake!” Politically, that seems to be an easy win. Who, after all, wants\nto ask the DEC permission to do anything on their property?\n\nIt is unclear at this point what actually would change with new DEC\nwetland mapping. The DEC says “not much,” but, nevertheless, legislation\nhas been introduced in Albany to be sure nothing much does change. It\nwould seem that the DEC has a lot of things it needs to pay attention to\nother than getting diverted off into some new controversy like expanding\nits wetland jurisdiction across the state.\n\nIn the midst of all of this, summer activity continues in high gear on\nthe lake, and the Season at Chautauqua Institution has been a busy one.\n\nVarious fairs, festivals, and community celebrations continue as they\nalways have—and\n\nthe fishermen continue to co-exist with the pleasure boat people. It\nalso seems that pontoon boats are becoming, more-and-more, the preferred\nwatercraft on the lake.\n\n-\n\nWe live in a pretty special place here, and there is nothing better than\na good summer on Chautauqua Lake!\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Thanksgiving and Deer Season\n\nIt is Thanksgiving and another deer season is upon us. Many around here\nwill likely spend some time at deer camp that day. In reflecting back,\nthough I have no historical proof of it, I have always thought that the\npilgrims likely ate venison along with turkey on that first Thanksgiving\nDay.\n\nLooking forward to deer season, I guess, is part of my DNA. I was once\nChairman of the Subcommittee on Fish and Wildlife in the State Assembly.\nEvery year we would have discussions with the DEC Division of Fish and\nWildlife about setting the fish and wildlife seasons in New York,\nincluding the big game season.\n\nIn full disclosure, you should also know that I have a Lifetime\nSportsman License (which I purchased some years ago) to hunt and fish in\nthe State of New York. I used to be at deer camp every year on opening\nday. Mobility issues and age have changed that, but I still have great\nmemories of those days.\n\nThough many may not realize it, we need a deer season. The size of the\ndeer heard needs to be balanced with the resources available to support\nits population. This is why there are various deer management units\naround the state. The New York State DEC issues additional permits to\ntake antlerless deer (also called doe permits) depending on the size of\nthe deer herd in those areas.\n\nUrban dwellers are now feeling the effects of what happens when there\nare too many deer. Just ask residents of Jamestown or Lakewood. Deer are\nnot dumb. They go where the eating is good and where they will not be\nbothered by hunters.\n\nIf we lived in a nonhuman environment, mother nature would maintain a\nbalance in the deer population—predators like wolves and coyotes\ncombined with disease and the weather would naturally contain and limit\nthe size of the deer herd.`\n\nSince we don’t live in such a pristine environment anymore, it is up to\nwe humans to help balance the deer population—that is why we have a deer\nseason and regulations governing the harvesting of deer.\n\nEven if you don’t like guns, you will have to admit that it is better\nthat deer be taken and used for food rather than seeing them hit by a\ncar and laying alongside the road.\n\nDeer hunters are a special breed. They understand all of this and are\nsome of the most protective conservationists I have ever met. To them,\nthe woods and the deer are sacrosanct.\n\nOften, I will ask them: “Did you get a deer yet?” And, the answer will\nbe: “Well, I saw a couple, but I am waiting for the big one.” What they\nare really saying is that they love being in the woods and are taking\ntheir time because they want to stay there as long as they can.\n\nI can remember the days when the deer population around here was very\nlow. I also remember when there were no turkey to be found, but the\npheasant hunting was good. Times and the wildlife environment have\nchanged. Now, there too many deer, and turkey, not pheasants, abound.\n\nIt is our common obligation to keep the wildlife populations in balance.\nTo my ears, gunshots in the woods this time of year mean not only that\ndeer season has started, but, also, that winter is right around the\ncorner.\n\nHaving a hunting season for deer is a good thing.

      "text": "Tariffs Are A Hidden Pre-Sales Tax\n\nWe all know about sales taxes. You buy something, like a car, you add 8%\nto that and then the car is yours.\n\nWe don’t like sales taxes, and, honestly, taxes are not something anyone\nreally likes. But, sales taxes are the prime source of revenue for state\nand local government here, they have been approved by legislative bodies\nin counties and by the state legislature, and we know what they are and\nwhat they are for.\n\nTariffs, at least the ones now being imposed by the President in\nWashington, have been approved by no act of Congress, seem to change\ndaily at his whim, and we are not sure what the new tax money will pay\nfor except, perhaps, for interest on the growing national debt.\n\nBut, the slickest political side to tariffs is that they are hidden.\nLet’s say a carpet comes into the Port of New York made in Vietnam. The\nfederal government slaps a 20% tariff on it, it gets shipped here,\nunbeknownst to you the price you pay for the carpet goes up 20% ,and\nthen the carpet merchant levies an 8% sales tax on top of that.\n\nAt least we know about the 8% sales tax which is added at the time of\nsale. Tariffs, though, are added before the sale. They are a\nfront-loaded, pre-sales tax. The money going to the federal government\nis never declared to the consumer. It is hidden and becomes a part of\nthe sales price. Consumers just have to eat it as an increased cost of\nbuying a carpet or of most imports coming into the country.\n\nWhat is also hidden is how tariffs hit the economy at various levels. A\ncar from Japan, school clothes from Bangladesh, cell phones from India,\nfurniture from China, steel from South Korea...you name it , and people\nare or will be paying 10%-50% more for depending upon what the President\ndecides. A couple of weeks ago President Trump announced a 35% tariff on\nCanadian goods coming into the country.\n\nThe beauty of tariffs in Washington is that it is a tax that nobody has\nto vote on. It is a wonderful system if you are trying to stay under the\npolitical radar. It also brings needed money into the federal treasury\nwhich just got whacked with another $3 trillion in projected deficit\nincreases because of the “Big Beautiful Bill” that was passed.\n\nThe selling job that the President has been pushing is promising that\nall of this will bring jobs back to the U.S.A. Yet, nothing much is said\nabout the fact that the economy is already at or near full employment,\nand workers are hard to find for the jobs that are now available.\n\nMany economists believe that the Hawley-Smoot tariffs imposed in 1930 in\nthe name of protecting American jobs only worsened the national\ndepression. We are not yet there, but it is hard not to believe that\nthis current wave of tariffs will have negative results. (It wasn’t that\nlong ago that the Republican philosophy in Washington was to create more\njobs through international trade and in opening foreign markets to U.S.\ngoods.)\n\nThe Federal Reserve Bank has held off on further lowering interest rates\nbecause of a worry that the increased cost of consumer goods could drive\nup inflation. We are in a “wait and see” mode right now as to how the\neconomy will go.\n\nYet, even if you like tariffs and support the President’s rather\nwhimsical way of imposing them—the fact that they are hidden from public\nview should gall you. Also, the way that they are being unilaterally\nimposed is akin to what in the past was called “taxation without\nrepresentation”... an approach to government that Americans have been\nknown to dislike.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

Congratulations to the county and to all who have\nbeen involved in the effort to complete sewers around the lake.\n\nNow that the financing is in place, the usual spadework has to be done\nto create a sewer district extension in this area. Detailed engineering\ndrawings must be completed, and all of the other details put in place so\nthat bidding can take place and the work begun. Commencement of work on\nthis last phase of sewer construction is estimated to begin in 2027 and\nbe completed by 2029.\n\nThe grant commitment recently received from New York State is a\nsignificant achievement. Without this funding, such a project would have\nbeen unaffordable for local residents.\n\nWe have come a long way in cleaning up Chautauqua Lake.

When it is all done, we will\nstill have a relatively shallow, eutrophic lake which heats up in the\nsummertime.

Now, in winter, you see dozens of ice fishing tents, snow\nmobiles and cross-country skiers out on the ice.\n\nIt is no wonder that close to 40% of the property valuation in the\ncounty comes from the five townships that border the lake.\n\nSo, congratulations to the county and to all who worked on finding the\nfunding for this last section to complete sewers around the lake. It is\na major achievement and all who live around or near the lake will\nbenefit from it for years to come.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

It is a proposal that should be considered.\n\nI can still remember the day when then Governor Andrew Cuomo went to\nDunkirk and promised a big crowd that the plant would be converted from\ncoal to natural gas...a plan that never got off the ground.\n\nWhat you see now, still looming over the Dunkirk harbor, is the shell of\nthe former coal/electric plant. It is doubtful that a natural gas plant\nwould need be housed in such a big structure...but these are matters\nthat could be resolved. What is important is that the basic\ninfrastructure of transmission, rights-of-way and a connection to the\ngrid are still available.\n\nA preliminary study was also done around the time of Cuomo’s visit\nconfirming that sufficient supplies of natural gas could be arranged by\nNational Fuel Gas including likely a connection to the Tennessee Gas\nPipeline that transits the northern part of Chautauqua County.\n\nThere has also been support given to the idea of converting the Dunkirk\nsite into a nuclear power plant location. I support nuclear power\ngeneration, but, unless things change, this would likely be a long-term\nproject—not one which would address the immediate needs of beefing up\nthe New York State power grid.\n\nThe whole issue relative to the Dunkirk power plant brings to the\nforefront the reality that quickly converting everything to non-fossil\nfuel is just not possible. There needs to be a balanced approach toward\nenergy which takes into consideration its cost to the consuming public.\n\nAt a minimum, the Public Service Commission, or a state agency, should\nconduct a study to determine whether the Dunkirk site could be used\nagain in some way.

      "text": "Ongoing Developments at the Bridge\n\nWork continues in rebuilding and repairing the Chautauqua Lake Bridge.\nThe community is now beginning to understand just how long and how\nsignificant this public works job has become.\n\nOne positive development for the driving public is that a new temporary\nexit has been built so that traffic can exit onto Rt. 430 on the east\nside of the bridge. This has made it a bit more difficult for\nconstruction crews, as most all of them will now need to access the site\nfrom the west side or Stow side of the bridge.\n\nYet, the addition of this exit should help ameliorate complaints in\nBemus that bridge construction has financially hurt businesses in that\narea.\n\nThis, of course, has brought up the whole matter of whether government\nshould reimburse private businesses for lost revenue.\n\nAs to that idea, I hope that the county will go slow in considering\nwhether to appropriate tax dollars for that purpose. There is always\ngoing to be business disruption when public works are being built or\nrepaired. Yet, when it is over, businesses located nearby could likely\nbecome stronger and even more profitable. Would then the government have\nan obligation to recoup its money?\n\nThis may be a “can of worms” that the county should avoid getting into.\nIn the end, the new bridge is going to benefit everyone, including those\nwhose businesses are closest to it.\n\nAs to progress on the bridge, it has slowed down a bit because of a lack\nof steel reinforcement bar (“rebar.”) It is not clear if this has\noccurred because of the new steel tariffs that are affecting the market,\nor if was just a “foul-up” by the state or the company supplying the\nsteel.\n\nIn any event, for most of August there has been no new concrete decking\nlaid because steel rebar has not been available. It is hoped that by\nSeptember, rebar will again start being delivered to the site.\n\nIn the meantime, the jobs of chipping, painting, and fixing potholes in\norder to get ready for the winter have been moving along.\n\nNight closures have been the “order of the day” recently, and the bridge\nhas been closed in a least one direction on many days from 9 or 10 p.m.\nto 6 a.m. the next morning. Thus, if you are heading home to Bemus,\nJamestown or Randolph from Erie at night—you had better be checking the\nbridge closing times, or you might be taking a detour through Mayville\nor Lakewood in order to get home.\n\nNext year, there will be even more inconveniences when the lanes on the\nnorth side of the bridge go under construction. That means that those of\nus who want to get off at Stow as we head west, will need to go to the\nnext exit at Stedman in order to exit the highway...another\ninconvenience.\n\nBut, take heart, soon enough this will all end, and we will have another\nbig, beautiful, four-lane bridge that we can drive over for, at least\nhopefully, the next 50 years!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

Subsequently, County Legislator\nPierre Chagnon, Sewer District officials, the current County Executive\nand other civic leaders have taken the reins to see the project through.\nPublic infrastructure projects like this take a long time to complete.\nAn idea which started over ten years ago is still being implemented\ntoday.\n\n“Why so long?” you might ask. The quick answer is that public projects\nlike this are long-term in nature, and also take time to get financed\nand approved. Think about expanding or creating a District, then\nsubmitting that for approval, then completing design/engineering\ndocuments including cost estimates and, finally, waiting for state and\nfederal grant programs to be created in order for the project to\nactually become affordable for local residents.\n\nUnderlying all of this were questions like “where will the collected\nsewage go?” “How will it be transported?” “What size pumping and\npipeline system will be required?” All of this takes time.\n\nIn general, the public supports such needed infrastructure. At the same\ntime, the average person just wants to see it done and doesn’t think\nmuch about the details of it. In the case of sewage, people just want to\nbe sure the toilet flushes. After that, it is somebody else’s problem.\n\nAs with other utilities, a sewer system needs to be planned for the peak\nday…not just the average day. The population around the lake likely\ntriples during the summer months when people are vacationing here. A\nsewer system has to be designed so that it will work in July when the\nlake is at its busiest. Yet, it must also work on its slowest day, which\ncould be in the middle of January.\n\nOn slow days In the winter, you don’t want pipes or systems freezing or\nsewage becoming stagnant because of slow flow rates. In short, it takes\ngood planning, engineering and, in the end, sufficient money…to get it\nall done.\n\nFortunately, on the money end, the Sewer District was diligent in\nseeking enough federal and state grant assistance so that Phase II, as\nbid, is expected to meet financial projections. It is about a $17\nmillion dollar job and will connect the end of the existing line at Stow\nto an already sewered area at Prendergast Point near the Fish Hatchery.\n\nIt is clear, especially when viewing the shoreline from a boat, that\nsewers were needed. Small lots 50-100 ft. wide situated close together\nalong the lake—just don’t have the space to contain both a working\nseptic system and a consistently safe water well. Now, that problem will\nbe solved.\n\nConstruction will start this winter, continue through 2026 and is\nexpected to be completed in 2027. Thanks to all who were involved in\nreaching this milestone… a project which will help preserve Chautauqua\nLake for future generations!\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

This has been the case where some, alleging that it would\nimprove the environment, have been pushing to stop the use of all\nnatural gas in our state.\n\nJust think what that would mean? The largest source of the energy now\ngenerating electricity in the state would be cut-off. The cleanest\nfossil fuel that we have would be shut down. And, if you live in a place\nlike Western New York, you would have to find a new way to heat your\nhome. In Albany, even the Capitol would go cold.\n\nThis anti-natural gas policy is nonsense. Not only is it bad public\npolicy, it would devastate the state and cripple the electric grid if\nthese policies were to be carried out.\n\nI would characterize New York State as being duplicitous and two-faced\non the issue. In the name of cleaning up the environment, we abolished\nthe ability to explore and produce natural gas in the state. The DEC\nwon’t give permits anymore to drill and explore for natural gas to allow\nfor drilling in the shale, which is an immense resource in the state,\nespecially in the Southern Tier.\n\nOn the other hand, our state, including counties downstate and the City\nof New York, continue to consume great quantities of natural gas. As the\nold saying goes: “We want to have our cake and eat it to,” though in\nthis case it is natural gas we are talking about. Though we won’t\nproduce it, we want others to do so and send it to us for our energy\nneeds.\n\nWhat keeps the lights on in New York City right now is that there are\nstill some old natural gas peaking plants which get turned on, on very\ncold days or on hot summer days when the air-conditioning load is high\nand more electricity is required.\n\nWe could have more efficient peaking plants in New York City, but “No,”\nthat would violate our state-imposed mandate to stop using natural gas.\nSo, we keep using the old, less efficient gas turbine peaking plants.\nAll in the name of cleaning up the environment.\n\nSuch policies are, of course, nuts...but, it happens, here in New York!\n\nAnd, what about installing a natural gas generator so that you can have\npower in your house if the electrical grid does fail? I expect that the\n“deep thinkers” in Albany and New York will soon find a way to try and\nstop that as well.\n\nThe ultimate reality for me, of course, comes here at home. Our furnace\nand hot water are heated by natural gas. Gas is a much more efficient\nfuel in producing heat than electricity...but who cares about that?\n\nThen there is the fact that a few years ago, we put in a small but very\nefficient natural gas stove. My back has gotten older and no longer\nwants to stoke a wood stove. But now, at least, I have the alternative\nof putting my feet up, putting the recliner back, pushing a button and\nthen watching a beautiful blue flame heat the room and most of the\nhouse.\n\nThey are “barking up the wrong tree” when they start threatening to take\nnatural gas away. More people are starting to understand that, though, I\nexpect, it will take a few more elections and some energy interruptions\nbefore the situation ultimately gets turned around.\n\nSomeday, they may find a way to transport hydrogen or some other fuel\nsafely to my home. But, in the meantime, I am sticking with the blue\nflame!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

It is not just people traveling to Chautauqua for its\nprograms, it is people from Chautauqua heading for Lakewood to shop and\nbuy groceries.\n\nYou just have to get used to the traffic. It is best to slow down when\nyou get on the road, and to expect that it may take you a minute or two\nlonger to get to your destination. This is especially the case as there\nare now stoplight restrictions related to construction work on the new\nsewer extension.\n\nThere have been complaints from the Sherman’s Bay area around Lakewood\nthat the weeds there are bad this year. This, despite the fact that the\narea was treated with herbicide. It seems the wind and rain this year\nmust have combined to push weeds into the bay.\n\nWeeds are nothing new on Chautauqua Lake. It has been and always will be\na eutrophic, shallow lake where weeds like to grow. Also, the southern\nbasin of lake is shallower and so weeds tend to be more of a problem\nthere. The weather and mother nature will continue to be the determining\nfactor in much of what we experience on the lake.\n\nBut human efforts to improve the lake are substantial. The Chautauqua\nLake Association continues to harvest and dispose of weeds, the\nChautauqua Lake Partnership continues its efforts at herbicide\ntreatment, and the Chautauqua Lake Property Owner’s Association\ncontinues to spearhead efforts to challenge the new wetland regulations\nwhich could impede property ownership rights on the lake.\n\nIn addition, the Chautauqua Lake Watershed Conservancy continues its\nfocus on preserving undeveloped portions of the lake, and there is an\nongoing research program called the Jefferson Project conducting\nscientific research on the lake.\n\nTo help bring it all together, there is a county-sponsored coordinating\norganization, the Chautauqua Lake and Watershed Management Alliance,\nwhich works to assist and help finance various lake-related\norganizations. The common interest of all of these groups is the health\nand maintenance of this beautiful body of water which dominates the\ncenter of Chautauqua County.\n\nFinally, there is now a new, significant “player” involved in lake\nissues—the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They have just begun a\nmulti-year study on how algae growth is affecting our lake, trying to\nunderstand it better, and, ultimately, finding ways to combat it. The\nArmy Corps has more experience and more money in dealing with the inland\nlakes and rivers in this country than any other organization—so it is a\nplus that they are now involved.\n\nIn short, there are a lot “moving parts” when it comes to Chautauqua\nLake. This also means that a lot people are involved. There are hundreds\nof citizens out there who are interested in the future of this\nlake...and that is a good thing!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

There has also been a lot of new concrete decking\nlaid—especially on the Bemus side.\n\nThere had been some concern about the potential movement of steel as the\nweight of the old concrete was removed. There is always some movement\nwhen this is done as there is some flex in all steel.\n\nIn crossing the bridge, you may have observed the various measuring\ndevices on tripods that have been positioned there. They have been\nmeasuring the movement or rebound of the steel.\n\nMy understanding is that all the measurements have been well within\ntolerances for structural steel like that of the girders underpinning\nthe Chautauqua Lake Bridge. The DOT has been diligent in measuring this.\nApparently, a model of the bridge and its weight-bearing characteristics\nwas actually built to replicate the process of removing the weight of\nconcrete during reconstruction.\n\nAs to what you will see as you cross the bridge this winter—not much\nwill change. The season for laying concrete decking is pretty much over.\nIt can only be laid within certain temperature tolerances, and with cold\nweather coming...that will end the pouring of concrete decking for this\nseason.\n\nThat does not mean that all construction work will cease. There is still\na lot of steel and concrete chipping repair going on beneath the surface\nof the bridge. It is expected that this will continue at least until the\nsnow or cold shuts it down.\n\nThe traveling public on the highway can see little of this subsurface\nwork.

I\ncan just see Hennessy telling the DOT engineers at that time—“We are\ngoing to build a big bridge over a magnificent lake in the area of the\nstate that I came from—so make it beautiful!”\n\nAnd, they did!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

It was not a job that he really\nwanted—he was plenty busy running the farm—but the Republican Committee\nasked him to run for the position, so he did.\n\nAfter a couple of terms, a neighboring dairy farmer, a Democrat, Frank\nBratt, decided to run for the job. My Dad’s reaction was: “Well, if he\nwins, he will do a good job.” Bratt did win, and I remember my father\nsaying shortly thereafter: “I guess I’d better get the Town books over\nto Frank so that he can get familiar with things,”—and he took the Town\nrecord books that he had over to Frank’s house.\n\nRecently, in this newspaper, there have been a couple of local\ngovernment stories—one good and one not so good.\n\nThe “not so good” story dealt with the resignation of some local\nofficials in the Village of Cassadaga over what seemed to be personal\nattacks or criticism of a project that had been undertaken by the\nVillage. Some opposed to the project had made life so miserable for some\nvillage officials that they decided to resign. A sad tale indeed.\n\nYet, there was another recent story of a local government which had been\nthrough a lot of scrutiny and public criticism over a proposed project,\nand their approach was to continue to hold hearings and meetings to\naddress concerns to try to find a solution.\n\nThat local government was the Town of Chautauqua, and the project dealt\nwith developing the old and now abandoned golf course at Point\nChautauqua.\n\nSuch projects are always contentious as many residents would prefer to\nleave things just the way they are.\n\nYet, local government has an obligation to do more than just block\ndevelopment—it needs to provide guidance for development...and the Town\nof Chautauqua has now done that. Not everyone will be happy, but town\nofficials are doing their job as it was meant to be.\n\nThe Town of Chautauqua surrounds the northern end of Chautauqua Lake\nand, in 2025 had a total assessed property value of $1.5\nbillion—representing about13% of the total assessed value of the whole\ncounty. Growth in the value of real estate is happening there—and town\nofficials should be given credit for taking on the important task of\nhelping shape that development.\n\nIn many ways, being a locally elected official is not easy. Many of the\ncalls that they get are from people complaining about things. At times,\nlocal government can seem like a thankless job.\n\nYet, local officials are doing important work, and we should be grateful\nwhen they are willing to “roll up their sleeves” and undertake the hard\nand challenging work of helping shape our future.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

That, by definition, has\nusually meant from one of the counties bordering the northern border of\nthe State of Pennsylvania.\n\nThink of Dan Reed from Dunkirk, Stan Lundine from Jamestown, Tom Reed\nand Amo Houghton from Corning. That changed when Brian Higgins from Erie\nCounty, through redistricting, became our Congressman.\n\nHiggins lived close by, in Buffalo, and I liked and knew Congressman\nHiggins. But, I must admit, I have always preferred a congressional\ndistrict centered on the Southern Tier. Someone who lives in Elmira,\nCorning or even Binghamton, I think senses more the unique challenges\nthat this district of primarily rural and small town constituents has in\ncommon.\n\nThe idea of “Southern Tier” has been redefined now with our current\nCongressman, Nick Langworthy, living in Niagara County.\n\nIt is not that Langworthy doesn’t “know” the Southern Tier...he grew up\nin South Dayton. It is just the fact that a precedent seems to have been\nset that the home of our Congressman can be moved to any location as\nlong as it represents a safe Republican District.\n\nCould our Congressman or Congresswoman come from, let’s say, Syracuse? I\nguess that is possible. The current representative of most of Niagara\nCounty lived near Utica, NY when she ran for Congress. She moved into\nher new district after the election and now lives near Syracuse, a bit\ncloser to Western New York...but still a long way away.\n\nThe people in Niagara County must suffer from a bit of political\n“whip-lash.” Their resident Congressman represents the Southern Tier,\nbut their actual Congresswoman, lives near Syracuse. Go figure?\n\nSuch are the ways of political redistricting.\n\nI remember when Amo Houghton was our Congressman, a person that I was\nclose to and often communicated with. He was with the other party\n(Republican,) but we had always gotten along largely because of the\nSouthern Tier connection.\n\nWhen I was in the State Assembly, Amo was Chairman of the Board of\nCorning Inc. He would periodically invite all of the legislators\nrepresenting the Southern Tier to come to Corning for discussions on\nissues facing the Southern Tier...often including the completion of the\nthen Southern Tier Expressway.\n\nI would climb into an airplane owned by Reggie Lenna (a Republican)\nalong with State Senator Jess Present (another Republican,) and we would\nfly to Olean, pick up Assemblyman Dan Walsh (a Democrat,) and then\ncontinue our flight to Corning where we would discuss issues common to\nthe Southern Tier.\n\nIt is not impossible for non-contiguous residents to represent our\ninterests, but I still think of the Southern Tier as being the “Southern\nTier.”\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Comparing the Cabinets of Trump and Lincoln\n\nWe have been inundated as of late with all of the announcements as to\nwho will be leading the federal government when Donald Trump again\nbecomes President next year.\n\nWhat has concerned me most, I expect, in the recent announcements, is\nhow little prior experience most of these nominees have had with the\nwork of the departments or the policy over which they will preside. My\nother concern deals with the matter of their willingness to express\nopinions which may be contrary to what the President wants to hear.\n\nOne of the more recent biographies of Lincoln was titled “Team of\nRivals.” In it, the author detailed how President Lincoln intentionally\nappointed people to top positions who he knew would speak their mind,\neven if it meant disagreeing with the President.\n\nPerhaps, the best example in Lincoln’s cabinet was his appointment of\nWilliam H. Seward as Secretary of State. Seward, who once lived here in\nWestfield, had competed with Lincoln to become President. He was also a\nformer Governor of New York and a leader in the abolitionist wing of the\nRepublican Party... whereas as Lincoln was more moderate in his views.\n\nThese differences didn’t matter to Lincoln. He wanted a person with\nstrong views, governmental experience, and an independent voice in that\noffice. Seward came as advertised and was always willing to tell the\nPresident “No” when he thought he was wrong.\n\nAnother strong personality in the cabinet was Salmon P. Chase, Secretary\nof the Treasury. Chase had been Governor of Ohio and always thought that\nhe should have been President, not Lincoln. He was so independent that\nhe would sometimes criticize Lincoln behind his back. Lincoln knew this,\nbut valued Chase because of his ability to raise funds to support the\nUnion during the Civil War.\n\nAnother independent personality was the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton.\nStanton was a Democrat, and often at odds with Mr. Lincoln. Lincoln\ndidn’t care. Stanton was a man who could bridge political gaps, raise an\nArmy and then focus the military efforts needed to carry on the war.\n\nThese three men were also often at odds even with each other, but\nLincoln encouraged that. He did not want “yes men” around him. He wanted\nindividuals who were respected by their peers in government and would\nspeak truth to power.\n\nI could be wrong but, at first blush, these characteristics seem to be\nlacking in many of our next President’s picks for top positions in our\ngovernment. Most of them seem to have been chosen because of their vowed\nfealty to Mr. Trump rather than their qualification for high office.\n\nTrump’s first Attorney General pick was so enmeshed in personal problems\nand with the ultra-right wing of his party, that even colleagues in his\nown party in the Congress tried to avoid him. A discredited Democrat who\nhas fringe ideas on health has been proposed to lead the Department of\nHealth and Human Services.\n\nThe first choice to lead Education is a former executive for World\nWrestling Entertainment. As to the military, though a veteran, we are\nlooking at a former Fox News personality with a rather blemished\nreputation and no experience working with the Pentagon to be our next\nSecretary of Defense.\n\nWe really haven’t seen anything quite like this in our history. Let’s\nhope that clearer heads in the Senate can prevail when confirmation time\ncomes.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

Yet, the DOT did its\njob. The snow removal during this very harsh winter was successful.\nNarrower plows were used to plow the snow, and, of course, a lot of salt\nhad to be applied to keep the two lanes open and safe. There were no\nmajor accidents that I know of, and traffic generally moved slowly and\nsmoothly over the bridge.\n\nNow that the weather has broken, construction crews are back, special\nconcrete is being poured to encapsulate and protect sections where the\ngirders meet, and demolition has begun on the bridge decking on the\nsoutheast side near the shore at Bemus.\n\nWhat we don’t know is what will be the ultimate plan for the total\nremoval and replacement of the bridge deck. Last year, concrete removal\non the southwest side of the bridge was discontinued so that further\nevaluation could be done as to the best way to complete demolition of\nthe old bridge deck during reconstruction.\n\nThere was some engineering concern expressed as to possible\nimbalance/torque issues as weight was lessened by the removal of the\nconcrete decking.\n\nWe have not heard from the DOT, but it appears from recent activity that\nthe plan must be to pour new decking after the old sections are removed\nso that construction vehicles and crews will have access and a platform\nto work from as bridge reconstruction moves along.\n\nWe do know at this point that new bearings have been installed under\nmost of the girders on the south side of the bridge, though not,\napparently, on the arched center section.\n\nAs to the request of the Village of Bemus Point to have a study\nconducted on the feasibility of including a walkway/bikeway as part of\nthe project, nothing has been heard.\n\nMotorists, for the most part, have been diligent in slowing down and\nobserving the yield signs on the entrance ramps in Bemus and Stow. I\nhave also heard that a lot of speeding tickets have been issued for\nthose exceeding the 40-mph limit. Slowing down is critical in ensuring\nthat entering traffic does not collide with through traffic at either\nend of the bridge.\n\nIt would be helpful if the DOT held regular updates on the bridge’s\nreconstruction. Such periodic updates would be welcomed by the traveling\npublic, especially by those who live near the bridge and use it on a\ndaily basis. (Which, by inference and disclaimer, I must admit, includes\nmyself.) In the meantime, we have to draw our own conclusions primarily\nfrom what we can observe.\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

      "text": "Chautauqua Lake Bridge Update\n\nFor those who use the Chautauqua Lake Bridge on a daily basis, there has\nbeen recent good news—there is now a “temporary” exit ramp for Bemus\nPoint on the eastbound lane just as you cross the bridge.\n\nBusinesses in Bemus and the Village had been asking that this be done,\nand, to its credit, the State DOT made the decision to do so.\n\nIt complicates things a bit for workers and contractors who had been\naccessing the bridge from the east side. They will now have to come in\nfrom the west side in order to avoid traffic using the new exit ramp.\nBut, the new arrangement, thus far, seems to be working.\n\nThe bridge has also been shut down on many nights to facilitate the work\ngoing on...at least some of the work being related to patching the two\nlanes now being used. Some closures have started as early as 9 p.m.\nwhich can be a “headache” for those using the bridge. But, the most\nrecent closing notices have been for shorter hours, like 3 a.m. to 6\na.m., making it easier for the traveling public using I-86.\n\nThere has been a noted slow-down in the past couple of weeks with the\npouring of new concrete decking for the section now being reconstructed.\nApparently, this is being caused by a shortage of steel reinforcement\nbar (rebar) which must be installed before the concrete deck can be\npoured.\n\nIt is not clear whether this shortage was a “foul-up” in ordering,\nwhether the supplier just ran out of it, or whether it could be related\nto a shortage in rebar caused by the new tariffs on steel. But, whatever\nthe cause, it is real. The latest I have heard is that the contractor\nexpects this material to begin arriving again in September so that the\npouring of new concrete decking can again proceed.\n\nThis week did see the commencement of demolition of more old concrete on\nthe south side of the bridge, so progress is being made.\n\nThere have also been news reports that some are seeking monetary\ncompensation for lost revenue due to the bridge reconstruction. As a\nstate and federal project, perhaps there is some provision in state or\nfederal law to make up for lost revenue experienced by nearby\nbusinesses. But, I hope that the County goes slowly in appropriating\nlocal tax dollars for this purpose.\n\nThere are always impacts when major public works projects of this kind\nare undertaken. Yet, in the end, new infrastructure, like a new bridge,\nbenefits everyone. If the County were to start reimbursing local\nbusinesses for construction-related lost revenue—where would it end? If\na business doubles its income after the project is completed, should\nthen the County come in and try and recoup these expenditures?\n\nIt seems to me that such a program could become a real “can of worms”\nand open the County and its taxpayers to all kinds of financial claims\nrelated not only to the Chautauqua Lake Bridge but to any future bridge,\nhighway or other infrastructure projects that come along. There are\nalready enough demands on the public purse in Mayville.\n\nAs to the bridge itself, winter is coming. There are still two or three\nyears to go before this project is completed. The days are getting\nshorter, and soon our beloved snow will again be falling. So, let’s hope\nfor a nice fall which will help those working on the bridge get as much\ndone as they can in 2025!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Bridge Reconstruction Ramps Up\n\nI don’t know if you have observed it, but it looks to me like there are\nat least double the number of people as usual now working on the\nChautauqua Lake bridge. It is obvious that the contractor is taking\nadvantage of the good weather and reconstruction work is ramping up.\n\nWhat you see visually is that new decking is proceeding on the south\nside of the bridge coming from both ends of the bridge towards the\nmiddle. I don’t know all of the engineering reasons, but it seems to\nmake common sense, as this is the way the original bridge was built,\ni.e. after the girders were placed, the decking and concrete paving\nstarted from both sides of the bridge moving towards the middle.\n\nIt seems that many of the additional people now on the bridge are\npainters. To reduce corrosion, the girders and steel work are being\npainted. They had not been painted before.\n\nThe bright, shiny steel surface that is now visible is what I would call\nthe “sub-decking.” It is the “floor,” if you will, upon which rebar\nfollowed by concrete will be laid.\n\nThis past week, the lighted signs on either side of the bridge have\nindicated that the bridge will be closed from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m. on\ncertain nights. Such closures are needed when the current open two-lanes\nare required to bring in steel, concrete or other materials needed in\nthe reconstruction. Some of this current night work is related to the\ncontinuing job of pouring special, corrosion-resistant concrete where\nthe girders meet the supporting columns.\n\nAs to the night closures, I give credit to the DOT and contractor for\nalerting the public. As I never go over the bridge in the middle of the\nnight, it doesn’t affect me. But, a trucker heading from Chicago to\nBoston who may want to use I-86 in the middle of the night needs to know\nwhen the bridge is going to be closed.\n\nThe DOT hasn’t announced it, but it would appear that the original idea\nof replacing the two lanes on the south side of the bridge first...and\nthen shifting construction to two lanes on the north side is now being\nfollowed. One must assume that the last decking to be laid will be on\nthe arched, center section of the bridge.\n\nMy wife has asked me, periodically, why I write so much about the\nbridge. I have tried to explain that I think it is a “guy” thing. Things\nmechanical, construction-related with engineering challenges have always\nengaged my interest. Whatever the reason, the whole project continues to\ninterest me.\n\nThe cost, obviously, is going to be substantial. I cannot but think that\nthere have been many change orders and unexpected repairs needed. Also,\nworking nights, overtime, and some weekends adds additional expense. The\n“jury is still out,” but I would think that the deep-thinkers at the DOT\nin Albany are hoping that the reconstruction of the Chautauqua Lake\nBridge doesn’t break their Interstate Highway budget.\n\nIf it does, it is for a good cause. We who live here and daily use this\nbridge realize that it has become an integral part of our community\nlife. It has united communities which for years were separated by a\n20-mile-long barrier of water.\n\nAs to the bikeway/walkway study being sought in connection with the\nbridge’s reconstruction, verbal communication with our Congressman’s\noffice indicates that funds for this program were discontinued in\n2023...so the prospects for such a study don’t look good.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Breaking Down The Barrier\n\nMost of my life has been lived in Chautauqua County, and, if there has\nbeen one common denominator or barrier throughout—it has been what we\ncall the “ridge,” the Chautauqua Ridge which separates the South County\nfrom the North County.\n\nIt is a division originating in mother nature. It separates two major\nwatersheds—that of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence Rivers. But, over\nthe years, it became more than that. The people of Dunkirk, Westfield,\nor Fredonia could seem like distant neighbors to those who lived in\nJamestown, Lakewood or Frewsburg.\n\nIt was no accident then that Mayville was chosen as the County Seat. It\nsits atop this ridge, somewhat in a neutral position, at the end of a\nfamous portage which linked the two major watersheds. It also sits on\nthe border between North and South County. It was closer to Lake Erie\nthan to Jamestown, thus acceptable to the North. Yet, acceptable also to\nthose in Jamestown in the South…after all, it was only a trolley or\nsteamboat ride away for them to get to the Courthouse.\n\nAgriculture also defines these regions. With a longer growing season due\nto its lower elevation and closeness to Lake Erie, grapes and fruit\ndominate the North. Dairy and upland farming define the South.\n\nThe weather is also different. The Ridge causes updrafts of the westerly\nwinds, cooling them as they rise more than 1,000 ft. in moving from Lake\nErie into the hills of the Southern Tier. In the winter, this usually\nmeans more snow along the Ridge.\n\nPolitics has always tracked these differences between north and south.\nIf, for example, the candidate for judge, in a given year, came from the\nSouth County—then, the next time around, it would be the North County’s\nturn to have the judgeship. Politics also reflects population—which has\nmeant that the greater population south of the Ridge was a concern for\nthose who lived north of it. The “big city” of Jamestown could seem\noverpowering to the smaller city of Dunkirk.\n\nOn the other hand, transportation advantages have always been in the\nNorth. Routes 5 and 20 followed by construction of the Thruway, along\nwith having the mainline of two railroads, have kept communities along\nthe Lake Erie shore in the transportation mainstream. Mainline rail\nservice today doesn’t exist in the South County, and it wasn’t until the\n1990’s that I-86 was finally finished, thus completing a transportation\ncorridor across the Southern Tier.\n\nThen there were communication issues. For years, phone conversations\nbetween Jamestown and Dunkirk were long-distance calls which cost extra\nmoney. There were (and still are) different radio stations in North and\nSouth. Yet, the newspapers have changed—they are now owned by the same\ncompany and today are sharing, more-and-more, news items between them.\n\nThe good news doesn’t end there. Several years ago, the Chambers of\nCommerce in South and North merged, and recently, the United Way\norganizations announced that they were merging.\n\nYes, the Ridge is never going to go away. But, slowly, surely, things\nare coming together—and that is a good thing. The barrier is breaking\ndown. After all, we do live in the same county!\n\nRolland Kidder, Stow, NY",

It is\npresented as a struggle of the “good guys” against the “bad guys,” and\n“never the twain shall meet.” There is not a search for consensus, but a\n“drawing of lines in the sand,”—we are right and you are wrong.\n\nAnd, everything is in the attack mode.\n\nSome of this, I think, goes back to Donald Trump’s relationship with a\nlawyer, Roy Cohn, whom he revered, and who advised him to always be on\nthe attack and never admit wrong.\n\nCohn was a force to be reckoned with back in the 1950’s. He first made a\nname for himself as a lawyer working for Senator Joe McCarthy, the\nultimately disgraced Senator who ruined a lot of lives by claiming that\npeople were communists and subversives, when they weren’t.\n\nI was reminded of this history recently while re-reading Theodore\nWhite’s 1978 book In Search of History. White, along with many others\nwho had served in the China Theater during the Second World War, had\nwitnessed the corruption and ineffectiveness of Chiang Kae Shek’s\nNationalist Chinese government and wrote about it. They also warned that\nthe communists in China were very well organized, and more effective in\nfighting the Japanese than was Chiang’s government.\n\nJoe McCarthy accused those speaking the truth about China as being\ncommunists and anti-American. For a time, White’s passport was taken\nfrom him—just because he had spoken the truth about what was going on in\nChina.\n\nThe famed reporter, Edward R. Murrow, finally exposed McCarthy for what\nhe was—a liar and a headline-grabber. Eventually, he was derailed by\nPresident Eisenhower and then censured by the U.S. Senate.\n\nHowever, Roy Cohn, McCarthy’s lawyer, survived all of this, went back to\nNew York and became a lawyer and litigator for the rich and famous of\nthat time. Donald Trump’s father and Trump himself were clients and they\nrevered Cohn for his the abrasive, aggressive, “I’m right and your\nwrong” approach to almost everything.\n\nIf Cohn were alive today, he would be neck-deep in all of the power\ngrabs and personal attacks coming from the White House.\n\nIn the end, the McCarthy approach to life and the law finally fails...as\nit did when Mao Tse Tung’s Cultural Revolution in China finally died in\n1976. The aggressors eventually turn on each other, progress goes in the\nwrong direction, there is an accounting...and, in time, society regains\nits sanity.\n\n“Going back to the 50’s” just won’t work over the long pull. Substance,\ntruth, reason, and the rule of law will ultimately return again. America\nwill move forward once again, and the nation will come together again.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Are We a Government of One?\n\nTo be honest, I have been dismayed recently by the actions of both\npolitical parties in what I would call a surrendering of our country to\na “government of one.”\n\nStarting first with the Democrats, it is clear that in deference to the\ndesires of a former President—they deferred into looking more closely at\nthe ability of Joe Biden to run again for that office.\n\nIt is now clear that there were many warning signs prior to Biden’s\nfailed debate performance last June, and that he should not have been\nthe presumptive Democratic nominee for President. Because of the power\nof the Presidency, Democrats in high places essentially “rolled over,”\nhoped for the best, and didn’t act until it was too late.\n\nThey erred in so doing, and more viable candidates for the highest\noffice in the land were thus thwarted in seeking that office. To put it\nbluntly, one of our major political parties failed the country. The\npower of the Presidency, the power of one—over-powered the normal\npolitical process of selecting a candidate for President.\n\nNow, we are compounding the problem by what seems to be the virtual\nabandonment of the Republican Party in opposing in any way the current\nPresident. Members of Congress, when President Trump says “Jump!”—they\nrespond,“How high?!”\n\nThere appears to be little or no backbone in the Republican Congress\nwhen it comes to proposals from the White House. It can be 145% tariffs\ntoday, and 30% tariffs tomorrow. It can be taking a gift of half a\nbillion dollars from a sheikh in Arabia so that our President can have a\nplush airplane with a gilded interior, or have him telling American\nUniversities that they must parrot the messaging of the federal\ngovernment or be shut down.\n\nWhatever comes out of the White House now is apparently infallible, and\nthe law of the land is to be set by executive decree.\n\nHowever you look at it, I see in all of this a demeaning of our\nconstitutional government. The Constitution was written to give the\ncongress, the executive and the courts equal jurisdiction over our\naffairs as a nation. If any branch of the government was to have a\nleading role, it was to have been the congress through the power of the\npurse strings.\n\nNow we stand in awe, apparently as helpless as sheep, while in the dead\nof night the House of Representatives rubber stamps the White House by\nripping down a great part of the government previously created by other\nRepublican and Democratic administrations to pay for unneeded tax cuts\naccelerating the deficit. All put altogether in a “one big Beautiful\nBill!”—whatever that means.\n\nI doubt that many members of Congress even knew what was in it. It was\ntoo much for at least one Republican member of the House from Long\nIsland who fell asleep that night somewhere in halls of Congress and\ndidn’t wake up for this monumental vote.\n\nIt seems that maybe the whole country is asleep. When will this end? It\nhas taken over 200 years, through fits and starts, successes and\nfailures, but, for the most part, with good intentions, to build this\ncountry making it the leader of the free world.\n\nNow we seem to be giving it all up to be ruled by a government of one.\nWe shouldn’t be going down this road. This is not what made America\ngreat.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "Appreciating the Snowplow Guy\n\nWhen you are young, you probably don’t pay much attention to the\n“snowplow guy.” But, the older you get, the more important he gets.\n\nThis past Thanksgiving weekend was a good example. We had been out of\ntown, at one of our kids’ homes for the holiday. We drove back on\nSaturday in good weather and found two feet of snow in our driveway.\n\nFortunately, it had been plowed...thanks to the snowplow guy.\n\nWe tend to forget about what winter around here is like. We have had\nsome easy ones, and, with four-wheel drive, you begin to think that you\ncan drive through anything. Then comes the lake-effect snow. Thank God\nfor the man who plows our driveway!\n\nThink though about what his life is like. He can’t take off for the\nweek-end, unless he has a buddy who will fill in for him. He has to be\nready to go at almost a moment’s notice. The weather man/woman is better\nat predicting the weather than they were years ago...thanks to the\npredictability of computer-generated weather modeling. But, still,\naround here, in snow country with lake effect snow...a lot of it can\nfall in a short time without a lot of notice.\n\nThen, think also of the investment. Snow plows today are not just an “up\nor down” relatively cheap mechanical machine. They have hydraulic\ncontrols which can collapse the plow into the form of a “V”, or direct\non which side of the road to push the snow. And, the plow must be ready\nto go all winter even if there is not a lot of snow.\n\nThen, there is the “time of day” question. Who wants to get up at 3 or 4\na.m. and start plowing driveways so that others can get up and go to\nwork at 6 or 7 a.m.? That takes a special kind of person.\n\nYou can’t stay up ‘til midnight and watch the late show, and then think\nyou can jump in your truck and start plowing three or four hours later.\nLike everyone else, the snowplow guy needs his sleep.\n\nI grew up on a dairy farm and got used to getting up early to milk cows.\nOn snowy days, after milking, we would plow the driveway. In those days\nwe had a tractor with chains on it with a simple “up and down” plow to\npush the snow. The driveway needed to be plowed so that the milk hauler\ncould get to the milkhouse to pick up the milk cans.\n\nI don’t milk cows anymore, but I am still an early riser and need to be\nplowed out. I know that Hogan’s Hut will open at 6 a.m. and I want to be\nthere soon thereafter to buy the morning paper.\n\nSo sorry, Mr. Snowplow Driver. I am one of those guys that probably\nmakes your life miserable in the early morning hours after a snowy\nnight. Yet, I do appreciate what you do. Thanks for sticking around\ntown, getting up early and doing your work so that the rest of us can\ntravel and go on our way!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "A Beautiful Day On The Expressway\n\nMost people now call it I-86, but I still call it the “Southern Tier\nExpressway.” That expresses what it truly is.\n\nOn an overcast day last fall, my wife and I were returning from the\nSyracuse area where one of our kids lives. It is quicker to take the\nThruway to get home, but I always opt for the back roads and the\nexpressway that threads through the hills of the Southern Tier.\n\nAs we came up the big hill heading west from Bath, the clouds were\nalmost touching the ground as we came to the summit of the pass at\nHoward. When we passed Hornell, I said to my wife, “I think we will be\nin the clouds when we go over the Alfred-Almond Pass”...and at over\n2,000 ft. above sea level we were.\n\nIt was a dramatic day to drive the Southern Tier Expressway. From\nSteuben County to home, the clouds hung like a draped cloth over the\nhills as the road wound its way west.\n\nAs we drove past the last sharp, almost-a-mountain hill, that juts up\nfrom the valley floor near Steamburg, I mentioned to her again about how\nthe clouds were obscuring its top. I call this place “Mount Parment”\nafter a friend who had the idea years ago that it would be wonderful\nplace to build a magnificent Monticello-type home overlooking the valley\nfloor and the expressway down below.\n\nThen, as we neared home rounding the bend right behind the Cheney farm\nand the Chautauqua Lake overlook service area, we again touched the\nbottom of the overcast. We came out of the cloud, slowed down and\ncrossed the now two-lane Chautauqua Lake bridge from Bemus to Stow and\nwere home.\n\nIt was one of those miraculous, cloud-filled days on the Southern Tier\nExpressway.\n\nThere are old, pre-expressway memories, now only remembered by a few.\nWhen I was in college, there was no expressway. It took about 2 hours to\ndrive to Houghton, NY. Now, with the expressway, you can reach Route 19\nnear Belfast in a little over an hour. Houghton is just up the Genesee\nValley from there.\n\nCharlie Henderson, a former Assemblyman from Steuben County, told me\nonce that he was responsible for the northern loop that the expressway\nnow takes going through Hornell, instead of following the route of old\nRt. 17 through Wellsville.\n\nI don’t know if that is true, but I always thank Charlie (now deceased)\nwhen I climb those magnificent passes at Alfred/Almond and Howard which\ntakes the Southern Tier Expressway past his old hometown. The views\nthere are incredible no matter what the weather is.\n\nThere are a myriad of stories of how the Southern Tier Expressway was\nbuilt. Most “tip their hat” to Senator Robert Kennedy who made sure that\nthe 13 counties of the Southern Tier of New York were included when the\nAppalachian Regional Commission was formed. That federal agency became\nthe source of much of the funding for the highway’s construction.\n\nAll of that, of course, is now ancient history. The highway is there. It\ntransits one of the most varied landscapes on the Interstate Highway\nSystem, and those of us who live along it never get tired of the\nbeautiful drive!\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",

      "text": "A Barbecue In The Backyard\n\nI read someplace, a long time ago, that this phrase was once used by\nformer General and President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower,\nin describing who an American was.\n\nIke is purported to have said something along the line that: “Americans\nare people who enjoy having a barbecue in their own backyard.”\n\nIt sounds a bit “hoaky,” but I can envision him saying it, and it really\ndoes say a lot about who we are.\n\nWe like our free time and are good at having fun doing it. Whether you\nare at a ball game, out on your boat on the lake, or sitting down in the\nbackyard having a barbecue—Americans like to enjoy themselves.\n\nIt also carries the story that we live in a country where we can enjoy\nourselves. The government doesn’t tell us that we have to have a\nbarbecue...that is our decision. We like our freedom and enjoy\nexercising it.\n\nThe idea of having our “own” backyard also helps define who we are.\nOwning a home or having a place that we call “home” is part of the\nAmerican dream.\n\nWe like to attend parades and patriotic events, like fireworks on the\n4^(th) of July, but we put family and friends on even a higher plane—so,\n“let’s have a barbecue in the backyard and invite some friends over!”\n\nWe are lucky in that our front yard (which is really our “back yard,”)\nfaces the lake. The other night we were cooking out, corn-hole and\nladder ball were being played on the lawn, a couple of kids were\nthrowing a football, the sun was setting over the lake and the old man\nin the group, me, was cooking at the grill observing it all.\n\nHow does it get any better than that?!\n\nI think that Eisenhower may have had a good thought going when he talked\nabout having “a barbecue in the backyard.”\n\nHe also understood the importance of home when he was commanding\nAmerican troops in Europe during the Second World War. He was giving\norders that would take many of those young American boys to their\ngraves.\n\nHe knew that they loved their country. He also knew that what motivated\nthem most was getting the war over so that they could get back home...to\nthat barbecue in the backyard.\n\nSometimes, it is the simplest things in life that can be the most\nmotivating. Ike didn’t need to preach about what “home” meant to those\ntroops...they already knew that.\n\nAnd, a big part of Eisenhower’s own story is that had grown up in a\nsmall town in Kansas where he had been given the freedom to have a\nbarbecue at his home, in his own backyard.\n\nRolland Kidder\n\nStow, NY",
